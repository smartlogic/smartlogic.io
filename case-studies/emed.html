        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.emed.com/">eMed™</a> is a medtech company that is democratizing digital healthcare. Their first product, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emed.com/products/covid-at-home-testkit-six-pack">Abbott’s BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Ag At-Home Test Kit</a>, was approved by the FDA in December 2020. These and other at-home tests have been crucial during the pandemic, enabling wide-scale testing with a much faster turnaround and far fewer concerns about exposure than traditional in-clinic testing. </p>
        <p>In order to quickly build all of the software infrastructure needed to support this large-scale testing operation, eMed worked with four software development teams, one internal and three external, including SmartLogic. SmartLogic began working with eMed in September 2020, and specifically built out the platform for remote monitoring and quality assurance, including tooling for managing proctors who supervise the home testing as well as a waiting room and queueing system for both proctors and patients. The at-home tests are proctored by trained support professionals to ensure proper testing protocols are observed.</p>

        <h2>Moving Quickly and Agilely</h2>
        <p>From the beginning of the project, speed was a clear priority; SmartLogic was able to ramp up a team of eight developers extremely quickly, within two weeks from the initial conversation with eMed. Over the life of the engagement, the SmartLogic team scaled up and down to meet necessary goals while providing flexibility to run a leaner team when fewer features were in development.</p>

        <p>This quick ramp-up was critical; SmartLogic helped eMed to meet tight timelines for product demos to meet FDA testing deadlines, and demonstrate partner integrations for their corporate partners.</p>

        <p>SmartLogic’s team brought our preferred technology stack for highly available, highly performant, and easily scaled web applications — Elixir/Phoenix, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes — and have worked to integrate it seamlessly with the preferred technology stacks of other partner companies. SmartLogic also contributed to the project management, requirements gathering, design, and cloud operations for the eMed project as a whole.</p>

        <p>The Elixir/Phoenix application that SmartLogic built provides both a web interface for test proctors, as well as API endpoints for the administration of proctors and the management of the patient waiting room for proctors to join testing sessions.</p>

        <h2>Managing Scale Gracefully</h2>

        <p>One important client for eMed’s at-home testing has been large companies who have sought to safely return portions of their global workforces to the office. For large distributed organizations, returning even 10% of the workforce to the office involves regularly testing thousands of employees a week, requiring hundreds of proctors to be available across many time zones. One component of the proctoring platform was specifically designed for managing the remote proctors, including shift management, robust permissioning, and administrative access, all while also observing strict privacy rules for the individual testees, per medical data privacy regulations from HIPAA.</p>

        <p>The proctor app was designed with massive scale in mind; at one point, the app was smoothly handling 2 million requests per hour. In order to gracefully manage the queue of proctors and patients, the SmartLogic team leveraged a special database row skip locking technique, to prevent errors that might otherwise arise with the volume of patients and proctors all interacting with the system simultaneously.</p>

        <h2>Cross-Team Collaboration</h2>

        <p>The SmartLogic team collaborated with eMed and the other development teams regularly, working within the larger microservices architecture designed to enable concurrent development by the four teams on each module within the larger eMed platform. As a startup, eMed’s potential markets and targets shifted over time; SmartLogic developed a number of custom proctor app variants, tailored to emerging market opportunities.</p>

        <blockquote>We loved working with SmartLogic — the quality of the work is great, they deliver on time, and the teamwork and collaboration from them is excellent.</blockquote><cite>—  Carlos Correcha-Price, Chief Communications and Marketing Officer, eMed Digital Healthcare</cite>

        <h2>Rapid Deployment and Evolution in a Fast-Changing Market</h2>

        <p>To date, eMed has successfully partnered with a number large multi-national organizations, as well as US states including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emed-announces-partnership-with-the-state-of-colorado-to-administer-millions-of-binaxnow-at-home-covid-19-tests-301220727.html">Colorado</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emed-announces-partnership-with-the-state-of-ohio-to-provide-millions-of-binaxnow-at-home-covid-19-rapid-tests-301212823.html">Ohio</a>, distributing millions of at-home tests across the nation.</p>

        <p>The proctor app that SmartLogic built for eMed was critical to their ability to bring their product to market; according to CCMO Carlos Correcha-Price, the proctor module is a key component representing roughly a third of their core product offering. The SmartLogic team was able to work quickly and effectively, collaborating with multiple other teams to deliver features and adjust to a fast changing market, setting eMed up for success.</p>
