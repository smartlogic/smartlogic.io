    <h2>Client Goals</h2>
    <p>A majority of working adults in the United States feel underprepared for retirement. The <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.tiaa.org/content/dam/tiaa/institute/pdf/insights-report/2023-01/longevity_literacy_financial_literacy_and_retirement_readiness.pdf">2022
        P-Fin Index</a> reports that 60% of US workers with retirement savings accounts feel unequipped to make savings
      decisions, and one in four lack retirement savings. With proper planning, people can improve their future finances
      and reduce the stress of uncertainty. Today’s workforce urgently needs education to improve financial literacy.
    </p>
    <p>The Bocce eLearning app plans to solve this problem and simplify retirement planning. The app transforms complex
      financial concepts into clear, manageable steps, equipping users with the knowledge to manage 401k accounts
      effectively. Bocce teamed up with SmartLogic to translate the vision into a digital reality.</p>

    <h2>The Search for a Software Development Partner</h2>

    <p>Bocce sought out an app development partner that could build an educational and responsive web app. After
      rigorous vetting of around ten candidates, Bocce Product Manager Chris Barnhill said they chose to work with
      SmartLogic on this project because the “responsiveness is stellar,” adding, "Every time we communicate with the
      broader team, we’re always looking for an elegant solution to complex problems. And SmartLogic does a good job of
      coming up with those elegant solutions.”</p>

    <h2>Scalable, Real-Time Applications with Elixir and Phoenix</h2>

    <p>Using tools like <a target="_blank" href=https://smartlogic.io/technologies>Elixir, Phoenix, and Phoenix
        LiveView</a>, SmartLogic translated Bocce's eLearning vision into a responsive web application, focusing on the
      ultimate goal of building a visually compelling and user-friendly interface.
    </p>

    <p>Initially, the Bocce team wasn’t familiar with the Elixir programming language. But, they were on board once the
      SmartLogic team demonstrated the language’s scalability and real-time performance capabilities. Chris shared, “Not
      a concern, but a pause - the tech choice of Elixir - our internal developer partners didn’t know what it was -
      they’ve evaluated it more and looked into it more in-house as well.” </p>

    <h2>Increasing Engagement with Gamification</h2>

    <p>To increase engagement and provide participants with immediate feedback, the Bocce app incorporates a variety of
      <a target="_blank" href="https://getbocce.com/pdf/Product-Overview-for-Employee.pdf">gamified elements</a>
      including short lessons, quizzes, and rewards. As users complete lessons and achieve milestones, they earn badges.
