                    <li>Built a secure module enabling federal program staff to evaluate and comment on challenge

                <p>When the U.S. government needed to expand access to its crowdsourcing platform, <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.challenge.gov/">Challenge.gov</a>, SmartLogic was the natural choice. Having
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://smartlogic.io/case-studies/challenge">built the original version of
                        Challenge.gov years earlier,</a> SmartLogic was sought out to return as their custom software
                    development partner for additional work building a new evaluation module that allows judges to
                    securely log in, review, and score submissions.</p>

                <p>SmartLogic was subcontracted by <a target="_blank" href="https://kaptivategroup.com/">Kaptivate</a>,
                    a strategic consultancy that blends innovation with strategic insight to help organizations thrive

                    technical support while remaining communicative and self-contained.</p>

                <p>“We’ve never had to chase them down. They’re sharp, responsive, and easy to collaborate with,” said
                    Jenn Stein, VP, Innovation & Workforce Strategies at Kaptivate. “What really stands out is how well
                    they match our drive—sharing the same passion for meaningful work and delivering real results for
                    our clients.”</p>

                    <h2>The Work: Building a Secure Evaluation Module</h2>

                    <p>The goal: Simplify and organize the evaluation process in a secure, scalable way. To meet these
                        needs, SmartLogic developed a comprehensive module that met both federal security and <a
                            target="_blank"
                            href="https://smartlogic.io/blog/accessible-ux-design-unlock-the-power-of-web-accessibility/">accessibility
                            requirements</a> while supporting an expanding roster of agency users.</p>

                    <p>The platform has a user-friendly interface that allows users to review, score, and comment on
                        submissions. The backend architecture had to seamlessly integrate with the existing
                        Challenge.gov platform. For secure login, we set up a system that utilizes a single login from
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> with third-party authentication and a
                        shared session tracking mechanism across both applications.</p>

                    <p>Security was of the utmost importance. To protect from vulnerabilities and outdated dependencies,
                        we added automated dependency updates. With all necessary protections in place, we developed a
                        scalable solution for use across government agencies.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Commitment Beyond Code</h2>

                    <p>SmartLogic’s value extended well beyond code, especially when the stakes were high and the
                        timelines were tight. We adapted quickly to changing requirements, maintained clear
                        communication, and consistently showed up as reliable collaborators.</p>

                    <p>"We basically had the Dan bat signal," said Jenn, referencing SmartLogic's longtime Director of
                        Engineering Dan Ivovich. "Even before we had a contract in place, he was helping our devs
                        troubleshoot a painful proxy issue. That level of commitment is rare."</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Outcomes: Expanded Access, Streamlined Workflows</h2>

                    <p>The evaluation module was built with a focus on securing user data and supporting adoption by a
                        broad range of federal agencies. By integrating secure evaluation tools directly into
                        Challenge.gov, agencies gain more control over their workflows and reduce reliance on
                        disconnected or ad hoc tools.</p>

                    <p>For Kaptivate, working with SmartLogic proved to be a low-stress, high-impact engagement.
                        SmartLogic delivered the evaluation module over the course of a 12-month contract, meeting all
                        key milestones and stakeholder requirements within the project’s original scope and timeline.
