        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Urban Teachers, a teacher preparation program, grew quickly after its launch in 2010. Urban Teachers used spreadsheets to hold data on a growing number of teachers, schools, and classroom results. The data came from disparate sources, including Urban Teachers and school staff. As Urban Teachers grew to serve over 85 schools with over 300 teachers in the classroom, the data became more difficult to manage using only a combination of Excel and Google Spreadsheets.</p>
        <p>"I was looking for an out-of-the-box approach to our data concerns at Urban Teachers," said Alex Mathews, Technical Services Specialist at Urban Teachers. Urban Teachers needed an easier-to-use database. They tried using Joomla, a content management system (CMS), but faced problems because it wasn’t robust enough for their needs.</p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>As Mathews started researching options beyond CMS solutions, he found SmartLogic. After talking with SmartLogic, Mathews "was really excited to work with a group that was willing to have the ongoing conversation about what we needed and what we didn’t." Mathews saw that instead of providing a customized off-the shelf-solution, like the Joomla approach that had failed, SmartLogic would be "a thought partner" for building a database that would serve Urban Teachers both in the present and as they continue to grow.</p>
        <p>For example, in just over a week, SmartLogic researched, architected, and launched a search engine for the database using Elastic Search, an open-source search and analytics platform.</p>
        <p>Throughout the project, Mathews was impressed by SmartLogic’s "openness and willingness to sit down and have a conversation." Instead of simply developing a product to provided specifications, SmartLogic would join Mathews in meetings where they would "throw around ideas and see what sticks."</p>
        <p>Because of this open communication, SmartLogic and Urban Teachers could build the best product for the present and the future. "They’re not just keeping blinders on, saying we must only look at the step right in front of us," said Mathews.</p>
        <p>The open communications, said Mathews, began even before the contract was signed, while still figuring out the scope of the work. Throughout the entire process, "the communication was responsive, back and forth—do you want to sit down, come to the office, or call or Google Hangout? There’s great willingness to do that." In just over a month,  had a new system that would replace its unwieldy spreadsheets.</p>

        <h2>The Results</h2>
        <p>Urban Teachers is centralizing their data into the new database so that they will no longer have to use spreadsheets. "That’s been the biggest win, just the ability to say that all of our data will be housed in here," said Mathews.</p>
        <p>Centralizing the data in the new database has saved time, and is easier on the staff. For example, just looking up a specific individual in the program "is so much easier than it used to be," said Mathews.</p>
        <blockquote>It’s been a great joy to work with SmartLogic. I definitely would recommend SmartLogic to other people who are looking to build some sort of custom web app.</blockquote>
