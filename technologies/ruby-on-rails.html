        <h2>A little bit about Ruby.</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> is a dynamic open source programming language, designed for ease of use and developer happiness. First released in 1995, Ruby has been a staple of web development for over a decade, particularly when paired with the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> framework. Ruby on Rails (RoR) was first released in 2005 and is an opinionated full stack framework for building web applications.</p>

        <p>Rails has consistently ranked in the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">top 10-15 programming languages used worldwide</a> over the past twelve years and continues to be a very popular language for web application development. Its readability, large community, and the wide availability of libraries (called Gems) all contribute to its continued popularity.</p>
