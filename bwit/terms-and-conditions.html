        <p>This program is only open to women (both cis and trans) in the Baltimore community. While we support the Baltimore tech community in its entirety, this program is specifically aimed at supporting gender diversity and empowering women.</p>
        <p>The projects completed in conjunction with the grants awarded with this program need to be completed in, and have direct impact on, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_metropolitan_area">Baltimore metropolitan area</a>.</p>
        <p>Grantees will be required to complete their projects by September 30, 2018. If the project is not completed within this timeframe, the remainder of the micro grant will be forfeited.</p>
        <p>Grantees will will not receive any portion of the grant funds until they have provided SmartLogic with receipts detailing purchases and how they relate to the project. SmartLogic will not release any funds without receipts. After providing acceptable documentation to SmartLogic you can expect reimbursement within one week.</p>
        <p>Grantees must notify SmartLogic of their intention to accept the micro grant within 48 hours of being notified of their selection. If a selected grantee does not notify SmartLogic within the above mentioned time frame, she will forfeit her micro grant award.</p>
        <p>Grantees will be required  to provide SmartLogic with a report about the outcome of their projects, including how the money was spent, how many people were impacted, and what was learned from completing the project.</p>
