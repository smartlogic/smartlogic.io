        <p>The SmartLogic apprenticeship program is designed to help provide an accessible onramp to a career professional software development. It is specifically geared towards those interested in beginning or transitioning into a software development career.</p>
        <p>The program is designed to teach apprentices to be better software developers through exposure to real-world scenarios faced by SmartLogic software developers on a daily basis. We accomplish this objective through a structured program that includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Following a course of study — tailored to you — to reinforce any skills necessary to become a full-stack developer.</p></li>
          <li><p>Working directly with our existing software developers on client work.</p></li>
          <li><p>Structured, organized feedback from other employees at SmartLogic.</p></li>
          <li><p>Structured, regular opportunities where we’ll solicit feedback from you.</p></li>
          <li><p>Mentorship from other members of our team.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In general: the apprentices are treated as any other member of the team, except with additional support during the apprenticeship period.</p>
        <p><strong>The Summer 2018 apprenticeship begins June 25, 2018 and concludes September 28, 2018 (14 weeks). We will hire no fewer than two, but no more than three, apprentices for the Summer 2018 cohort.</strong></p>
        <p>At the conclusion of the program our goal is to present each apprentice with an offer of full-time employment with SmartLogic. Should this not be possible due to the amount of client work we are forecasting then we will work diligently to ensure that the apprentice has secured a full-time position in the world of professional software development with another local company we think would match your skill sets and interests.</p>
        <p>We hope to run the program in the future but will make that decision after the Summer 2018 cohort has completed its apprenticeship.</p>
        <p>For the duration of the 14-week apprenticeship you will be paid $10,000 (before tax withholding, social security / medicare, and withholding for benefits). You will also avail of the other benefits available to any full-time employee of SmartLogic, most notably access to extremely affordable (in some cases free) medical, dental, and vision insurance.</p>
