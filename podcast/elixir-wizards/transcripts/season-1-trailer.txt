Justus:             Hi, I'm Justus.

Eric:               And I'm Eric. And this is Smart Software with SmartLogic.

Justus:             Smart Software with SmartLogic is a podcast where we discuss new and emerging technologies in web and mobile software development. For this first season we'll be focused on Elixir in production. So if you're a programmer, startup founder or a technical manager who is curious about Elixir, Smart Software with SmartLogic is the podcast for you.

Eric:               As experienced developers we know that web development is constantly shifting. New languages are fun to play with, but what does it mean to run them in production? This is why we're interviewing developers from around the world who are running Elixir and Erlang in the wild, use it daily and are happy to share their experiences with us and our listeners.

Justus:             Our guests come from all around the world of Elixir. We've got Todd Resudek from Weedmaps, Brooklyn Zelenka, the CEO of Special Projects and Decentralized Engineering and many others. Do you have a question that you'd like us to ask them, send them in. We promise you by the end of this season you'll be an elixir alchemist, just like us.

Eric:               So get ready. The first episode of Smart Software with SmartLogic drops on February 28th. Our first guest is Dan Ivovich who is a Director of Developer Operations here at SmartLogic. He'll be sharing our background on Elixir and the projects we build with it.
