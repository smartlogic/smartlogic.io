It's been a while.[00:00:05] David: Hey![00:00:06] Mark: Hey guys, we're crashing your show. [00:00:08] Sundi: Or we're crashing[00:00:09] Owen: we crashing your show?[00:00:11] Mark: I don't know, we're having fun.[00:00:13] Owen: being crashed[00:00:14] David: are we just burning here? Are we crashing and burning? [00:00:17] Sundi: We're letting it crash, David. we're launching like SpaceX. This is how it goes. Sometimes[00:00:23] Mark: Yeah, let's hope we can land this.[00:00:24] Owen: we get off the ground.[00:00:27] Owen: Let's keep[00:00:27] Owen: this metaphor going.[00:00:28] Sundi: Or not, Owen. Or not.[00:00:30] Owen: Yeah. Okay. Okay.[00:00:31] Sundi: Welcome everyone. , welcome to our, our Hype isode for ElixirConf 2024. We are very excited to be here with our friends, thinking Elixir, and wow, for, for our audio listeners and, you know, this will be on YouTube, but, um, Owen's got his, uh, All of them?[00:00:47] Sundi: All of them?[00:00:47] Owen: I'm ElixirConf badge rich.[00:00:49] David: you've got your badges. Dang.[00:00:52] [00:00:52] Mark: Kept all of his badge lanyards, it's awesome.[00:00:54] Sundi: Oh my[00:00:54] Sundi: gosh. [00:00:55] Owen: I wear them every day.[00:00:56] Sundi: I have all of my badges ever hanging on the back of my office door and my cat loves them.[00:01:01] Mark: Ah, nice.[00:01:02] Owen: Uh, Oh, that's a great idea.[00:01:05] David: I'm pretty sure I've thrown all mine away. Yeah. I don't keep on to that stuff.[00:01:10] Sundi: I always think I should. I'm not a pack rat normally, but, uh, yeah.[00:01:16] David: but this is, this is sentimental to you, huh?[00:01:19] Sundi: I guess it is.[00:01:20] Mark: The conferences are really significant. You know, it's like one of those moments in your life. You're like, wow, I'm always going to think back on this. I need a memento. And there you have it.[00:01:29] David: Okay. Yeah. So, so what are, I'm curious, you know, we, we are talking about ElixirConf. I would say that Elixir has been a season of a lot of our lives, right? There's probably some memorable moments. Is there a super memorable, ElixirConf or Elixir related kind of a moment, like the day you got a job doing Elixir, like [00:01:50] Sundi: 30 minutes of dad jokes.[00:01:52] Owen: That's a good one.[00:01:53] Mark: That was funny. Yeah. People who attended virtually probably spared that.[00:01:58] Sundi: I hope they were. I hope they were.[00:02:01] Owen: They got the live feed without any of the excitement and the joy of just looking around and seeing everyone. Just[00:02:08] [00:02:08] Owen: the handoff. Yeah.[00:02:10] Sundi: Mm hmm.[00:02:10] David: Just[00:02:11] David: the[00:02:13] David: collective feeling of being let down.[00:02:15] Sundi: Mark, David, did you know each other when you went to your first ElixirConf? Or did you know anyone when you went to your first ElixirConf? How was that for you guys?[00:02:22] David: Yeah, uh, I knew nobody. Let's talk about what year our first ElixirConf was. Mine was 2016, I think.[00:02:31] Mark: the one in Aurora, Colorado. Oh.[00:02:36] Sundi: I think that was technically my first one also. Was that 21?[00:02:40] Owen: Mine was 21 in Austin. 2021.[00:02:44] Sundi: Oh, no, that, yes, that was my first one. It was confusing because Lone Star Elixir was at the same venue the year before.[00:02:52] Owen: Actually, that's when we met. 'cause I was a new SmartLogic employee. Who was starting the week after ElixirConf.[00:03:00] Sundi: Yes. Owen's the[00:03:02] Sundi: overachiever who[00:03:03] Sundi: started early.[00:03:04] Owen: that actually talking about memorable experiences. Does anyone remember the elevators at embassy suites? [00:03:11] Mark: Oh yes. [00:03:12] Sundi: I try not to. [00:03:14] Mark: there was a blackout.[00:03:15] Owen: They[00:03:15] Owen: were definitely not running on a supervised process.[00:03:17] Owen: They were like, just chaos mode.[00:03:20] Mark: Oh no, no, that was a different thing. Okay. I just remember when I, when I arrived at the Aurora conference there was a blackout that was covering most of the city, And I was even kind of unaware of it. It's just like, Oh, it's kind of, you know, dim lighting, you know, maybe it's like ambiance or something.[00:03:37] Mark: And then, and then you go to the elevators and the elevators were working because they were on generators. But you get up to your room and it's like, Oh, it's just completely black. [00:03:44] David: yeah, there is something wrong.[00:03:46] David: Let's see. Yeah. 20, 2016 was in Orlando, Florida, which we're having it here again. All these years later, but this, that one was the one with the dolphin and the swan. Those were the hotels there. It was on campus at Disney World. So I bet a lot of folks went to Disney World that, that trip.[00:04:03] Sundi: uh huh,[00:04:04] David: And then, yeah, and then 2017 was, I, was it 2017?[00:04:09] David: When, when was the first time we went to Aurora? [00:04:11] Sundi: We need a history of ElixirConfs. There are like, what, 11, 12 years to look at? What, what number are we on, 11?[00:04:18] David: Golly.[00:04:19] Sundi: like that.[00:04:20] David: Oh, here it is. Oh no. 2017 was in Bellevue, Washington. I went to that one too. That one was great. it was 20 it was 20 [00:04:28] David: and 2018. So 2017 and 18 were, were in Washington. It wasn't until 2019 when we went to the Rockies.[00:04:36] Sundi: Yes. That sounds right.[00:04:37] David: Golly.[00:04:38] Mark: Yeah. 2019. That's the one I went to.[00:04:41] David: Uh huh. And then supposed to be 2020 going to the Rockies again, but I, I don't remember what happened in 2020.[00:04:49] David: Do you remember what happened?[00:04:50] Sundi: Black hole where that year is. [00:04:52] David: Yeah, it was just a freaking black hole [00:04:55] Owen: No clue. [00:04:56] Mark: I mean, is that a, is that a COVID issue? I don't know. [00:04:59] David: [00:05:00] pandemic. [00:05:01] David: Everybody lost a year of their life.[00:05:03] Owen: Yeah.[00:05:04] David: But that's when it, uh, it went fully virtual, that time. Yeah. [00:05:10] Sundi: I'll, come on the other side of that. I think 2020 was the best year of my life.[00:05:15] David: Hmm.[00:05:16] Sundi: the year I started at SmartLogic. it kinda, like made the year for some folks, and other folks, it just like wrecked everything, you know? [00:05:24] Sundi: I don't know. I often think about where I'd be in my life, my career, if not for having to like shift gears kind of necessarily that year. And, you know, I might not have been in Elixir still. I might not have done a lot of things. I wouldn't be here for sure. I wouldn't be in my house. I wouldn't be in my city.[00:05:41] Sundi: None of it. Yeah, so some things. You gotta look at the bright side of things. Um, but yeah, David, Mark, I was asking about, did you know anyone? Because, you know, your first, your first ElixirConf for, for folks who are listening in, who maybe who've never gone, who are going this year, what should they expect?[00:05:58] Sundi: How should they interact with the world around them when they, when they show up?[00:06:01] Mark: Well, I was thinking about that before we came on together. And, and really the thing that stands out to me is don't be afraid to talk to people and it doesn't, you don't have to be like super gregarious, go out and talk to everybody and shake their hands, give them hugs. Like, Oh, stranger, you know, you don't have to do that.[00:06:18] Mark: But like, just when you take a, when you sit down at a table for a meal, sit down with someone you don't know, just a group of people and just introduce yourself and learn about them. Where are they work? What kind of stuff are they doing? I learned so much interesting stuff. Just, you know, you consider that hallway track kind of stuff, but people doing crazy, cool things with Elixir in all these different situations that you don't hear about publicly, like these are not public companies and some of these.[00:06:45] Mark: So this is back when I was on Elixir Mix. And I was like, Oh, can I have you come on and talk about that? And like, no, I can't talk about that. [00:06:53] David: Gold mine for you.[00:06:54] Mark: Yeah. It's like, Oh, wow. That's really cool stuff. This company, this big old company is using Elixir in a way that's not public. And you can just find that stuff out when you talk with people.[00:07:04] Mark: What are you doing?[00:07:05] Sundi: Yeah, I, I loved that part of, um, I was just at the grocery store the other day. I picked up my Bowery Farming lettuce. I was like, grown with Elixir. I'm gonna eat this today. And I found that out from just talking to somebody after one of the ElixirConfs. I think we were at the airport, and they mentioned Bowery Farming using Elixir and I was like, ooh, that's fun.[00:07:29] Sundi: I've seen them.[00:07:30] David: Yeah. I've, I've gone to these conferences like in a variety of mindsets. Like the very first one, 2016.. That was just three years into ElixirConf in the US at least. That was the third one they had. So it was pretty early, you know, like. That was 1. 3, Phoenix 1. 3, like contacts weren't, weren't a thing back then, right?[00:07:49] David: So just to get a my, a reference of what was going on. Ecto 3. 0 was just announced, I think, right? They were still doing, we were still doing like records and not maps or structs in Elixir. I think it was about that long ago. Anyway, so, That time ago, I was, uh, uh, I was just really becoming a Ruby developer.[00:08:09] David: So I was going there to like, literally just learn. I just wanted to learn more about it. I didn't have the opportunity professionally to learn it. The next year, it was more about networking. I wanted to find that job and get that money. Making that Elixir code, right? And then, yeah, a couple years later, um, the whole pandemic happened.[00:08:32] David: Established in my job, now it was more like, there's a couple of topics that I'm like, actively searching out that I want to learn more about. But then also, yeah, it was just more networking, I guess, but I wasn't really about a job anymore. A couple years after that, it was purely about talking to people.[00:08:47] David: I did, last year, I honestly, and not, not that the conference was bad, because it wasn't, it was, it was awesome. I was just in a different place. I didn't really care about going to the talks anymore. It was all about the hallway track. Like, I, when I first started going to conferences, I was very confused.[00:09:05] David: What are people talking about when they talk about the hallway track? Like, there is no track out here. What is going on? [00:09:12] Sundi: We[00:09:13] Sundi: should show up with some railroad tracks one year, just to, just to mess with[00:09:17] Sundi: people. [00:09:18] Mark: Give it an official place. Yeah.[00:09:19] David: just a real facepalm of like, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm the dumb one. It's just the, it's just people talking in the hallway. That's all it is. It's real easy stuff. Um, but yeah, like what Mark said, you, you really can't afford to be a wallflower, you know, you got to go sit down, open your mouth, start gabbing at some folks and, uh, you never know what, you know, what they're going to be doing.[00:09:43] David: Met people from Pepsi, met people from, D Scout where I work at now, I've, you know, I've met Fly. io people, all sorts of people. And that network, , that sticks around you know, if you're in the community, you get to meet these people in the flesh and blood. You know, you know, I wasn't there for this, [00:10:00] but I know that, when Benjamin Mild, I'm, I'm probably screwing up his name, when he was introduced on stage somewhere, like, people gave him a standing ovation because of how, how much, he has done for the community, you know, I'm, I'm nowhere near that, but like, they already knew him.[00:10:16] David: Just getting to share that real in person camaraderie with him must've meant the world to him. I, it had to have been, right. But those, yeah, being in person, I think is pretty, pretty incredible at ElixirConf.[00:10:28] Sundi: Yeah, for sure. Owen, you, um, you were gonna go to ElixirConf on your own in 2019, or sorry, 2021, was it? And then you joined SmartLogic kind of like in between having, yeah.[00:10:43] Owen: Yeah, I was writing PHP full time. Yay. And then, just the way the timing worked out, you know, got hired at took the week off for ElixirConf and then started here at SmartLogic immediately after I got back. So that was cool. Cause I got to meet you, Sundi, and then Yair, and I forget who else was there.[00:11:03] Sundi: Yeah, we had a few other folks there at the time on the team.[00:11:06] Owen: Yeah, so that was fun. A great way to like, kind of get introduced to your team. Like you're, I don't know if everyone's going to go and meet their coworkers at ElixirConf. [00:11:14] Sundi: I did that. Yeah. I did that last year. I had only been at CARS for like two weeks and then I met like 16 different engineers and some of those engineers have been working with folks on my team for like five years and they've never met. But I met them because of ElixirConf.[00:11:31] Owen: David, when you're talking about Benjamin, another thing that I remembered was, I think I've been to a few of these now, people will come up to you and tell you their avatar name. Hey, I'm so and so. And you're like, wait a minute. I know that, I know I've seen this person online, but I have no idea.[00:11:46] Owen: Like, so you're going through like thousands of conversations probably in a week, [00:11:50] David: Yeah, [00:11:50] David: I, I, I don't know, total aside, but I, I, that, I have a screen name, you know, back from my AIM days, AOL days, and, uh, like, I kept it, but it is thoroughly gamer related only, you know, like, I only use that for, like, PlayStation or something, no one's gonna find, well, they probably won't find me up there, but, like, [00:12:11] Owen: David Pwnz [00:12:12] David: Yeah, right? It's, it's, it, it, but no, nowhere, uh, you know, it's even public or professional setting like Twitter, I guess, or GitHub. Like, you won't find silly screen names from me. I don't know. It just, it was, it's just like two different characters, really. Like, I'm[00:12:31] David: playing two different characters.[00:12:32] Sundi: on the other side, I don't think I would know how to find Mark in Slack without [00:12:38] David: Brain Lid.[00:12:39] Sundi: The not just BrainLid, but BrainLid and that exact profile photo. He can't change it.[00:12:46] David: Do people walk up to you, Mark, and say, Hey, Brain Lid.[00:12:50] Mark: No, it's never happened.[00:12:52] Owen: Hey, it's me, BrainLid.[00:12:53] Sundi: If you're listening to this episode and you see Mark sometime in the future, please walk up to him and say that.[00:12:59] Owen: Yes. That would be awesome. Well, one of the, one of the things I want to point out is how we're talking about jobs and how you guys have gotten jobs. And I just want to point out that really. In just not even just like Elixir community, but just programming career path in general, networking is really where jobs happen the most, right?[00:13:20] Mark: You're not doing the cold, send in a resume to a website most of the time and having a great success. It happens, you know, I've done it before, but a lot of the really best transitions to a new job happen through networking. And a lot of us are working remote now, right? So we don't, unless you have like local meetups that you're going to or something like that, there aren't a lot of opportunities for networking, like face to face time of making that connection and conferences really are the best stand in we have for that, that supports that.[00:13:54] Mark: So I don't know. Is that something that you guys have, you feel that way as well?[00:13:59] Sundi: It's the advice I give to every person in the job market right now. If you're looking for a job right now, I feel for you. This, this market is brutal. If I could hire all of you, I would. It's just, it's so bad. And everyone, even with referrals. aren't getting callbacks, and that's kind of infuriating on one side, scary on another side.[00:14:21] Sundi: I keep telling people if you can somehow get yourself to ElixirConf, I think, I think you'll get a leg up by going there, but I, you know, you can't guarantee it, but you really do tend to make some of best networks when you, when you go in person.[00:14:35] Mark: I'll just throw out there, there's the smaller ElixirConfs, like the regional ones. Those are great too. And, you know, just put yourself out there. Say, I'm going to give a five minute lightning talk, share something cool that you're working on. And, Oh, I'm looking for a job, you know, something like that.[00:14:48] Mark: Just let people be aware. Put yourself out there.[00:14:51] David: Yeah.[00:14:51] Sundi: anyone[00:14:52] Sundi: go to one of the smaller ones this year?[00:14:55] David: I keep on telling myself to do it. I haven't done it. I haven't done it. [00:14:59] Sundi: [00:15:00] Well, you, you're, you're local now to [00:15:02] Sundi: ElixirConf, so [00:15:03] David: I, I, I [00:15:04] David: guess. Yeah, [00:15:05] David: I can drive. Yeah, it's, it's funny, it's been held there, like, three times now, and This is the first time I'm actually living here to go to. I can drive to it now.[00:15:14] Sundi: Owen, now that you're back in Texas, you've got to, you've got to get Jim on those Austin ones again.[00:15:19] David: yeah, go back to [00:15:22] David: the birthplace. [00:15:23] Owen: right, I'm in, I'm in North Dallas, which I think Jim's around here somewhere as well. We're off on a tangent, but like, there's not as far as I know, like any kind of official meetup happening in this area. There is one in Austin, which I'm dying to get to, but actually they're having one the day that we're recording this. But I've got an EV with just not quite enough [00:15:41] David: Hahaha. Should have [00:15:44] Owen: charging up, [00:15:45] Owen: you know, both[00:15:46] David: gotten that hybrid. Hahahahaha.[00:15:51] Owen: David, you're the voice of my conscience every single day. I go on a long trip. Yes. So yeah, that's, uh, yeah. If I wanted to rent a car, you know, go out for the night or something, that would be the way to go.[00:16:01] Owen: But[00:16:01] David: I am very excited about the Rivian R2, but that's not why we're here. We can't, We can't, we shouldn't, we, if we, if we start [00:16:08] Sundi: talking about cars, we'll be here for a while.[00:16:10] Owen: Car talk. Ha ha[00:16:12] Mark: a bunch of people will just say, skip.[00:16:14] Sundi: Yeah, we'll have to give them timestamps.[00:16:17] David: You did mention though, uh, meetups and I, I want to say that they're less effective nowadays, but that's just my personal experience, but I know that like a couple of years ago, and it's probably very localized. So it depends on your area that you're in, but meetups were even more helpful, I think, for getting that job.[00:16:34] David: Uh, more than conferences. Um, the virtual ones, you know, they're, they're still pretty good. And as, and that works well for like remote ones, but I feel like, uh, the, I don't know, the excitement around Meetup in general, it's kind of died down. I don't know if that's like, everyone got their fill. [00:16:54] Sundi: The tool still sucks.[00:16:56] David: Yeah. The tool still sucks.[00:16:58] David: The, but also I think everyone, everyone went so hard so quickly into remote. And then I think there was just kind of a, a recoil, you know, in the past couple of years and want to, people wanting to go back to physical, but I haven't seen the meetups pick back up myself, but I don't know if think,[00:17:16] Sundi: no, I think that's true. I think there is something in the, the industry right now where offices aren't back in, in session, right? So no one is paying for meetup space. So where do you go host a meetup? If you, if I wanted to pick up and make DC Elixir. In person today, I think I could get 15 people there maybe.[00:17:37] Sundi: Um, but where, who can have it, who can host it?[00:17:40] David: That's Sundi's house.[00:17:42] [00:17:42] Mark: like if you meet at a pub or something like that, or a restaurant, it's very casual. You're not set up to be able to do presentations or anything[00:17:50] Mark: like that. So that's a challenge. Yeah. You got to like, yell, yell over each other. Cause there's another loud group next to you or something. [00:17:58] Owen: Yeah. I think when, when you're working at a place that has like a nice conference room and it's like a, you know, places using Elixir that's kind of like easy mode for having an in person meetup, you know, if you're, you know, if you're upper people are on board,[00:18:13] Owen: but yeah, if everyone's remote, it's harder.[00:18:15] Sundi: the New York folks are having every once in a while, uh, in person meetups. I've been seeing some of those photos come through.[00:18:21] David: Yeah.[00:18:22] Sundi: Ah,[00:18:23] David: Depends on your area. Like, like I said, there'd probably be a. Mmm, yeah, there's one person in my town that would go to my meetup. That would be me.[00:18:34] Sundi: Yep. So, but we're, you know, hopefully we are getting a chance to see each other in, Orlando, uh, this year. Why don't we real quick, just for those listening, uh, kind of rattle off the, the specs, the specs, what are these, the stats? What are we, what are we talking about? What are the current price tickets?[00:18:51] Sundi: Okay, 2024. Elixirconf.com is where you will get your info that I'm about to rattle off. [00:18:59] David: We go to the conference, conferences, tickets are a thousand dollars. It's 999. If you want to save that extra dollar, that's cool too. Training is 5. 99 on top of your conference ticket. You could go there just for training. If you really wanted to. Uh, there are virtual versions of all these for a bit off of, uh, of the full price of the, you know, the, the, the regular ticket and that as until July 31st, and I can't remember, you might check your emails because I know Jim has extended some of these timelines.[00:19:31] David: So what I'm saying today may not be true tomorrow. [00:19:34] Sundi: right now the website says expires, uh, Wednesday, July 31st. [00:19:39] Sundi: And then it goes into, I [00:19:41] Sundi: think, roughly 50 to 100 more for tickets. [00:19:45] David: So those virtual ones, which is a good option by the way, but you're going to miss out. I. I think I, my perspective, you're going to miss out a lot on the networking. So if that is a primary reason for you, like job search kind of stuff. You're going to want to be there in person, [00:20:00] and so those personal, those in person tickets are 1, 000 and 600.[00:20:05] David: The virtual ones are, like, essentially half the price. The virtual conference is 250, so that's very attainable for anybody, you know, uh, in the developer space, that, to go there and learn, yes, some Erlang and Elixir. And then virtual training is going to be about 500. That's not quite half, but it's still, um, a lot of effort goes into those training classes.[00:20:25] David: I'm sure Owen is going to, going to, tell you. So that, that, [00:20:28] Owen: Oh, really? [00:20:29] David: that's still, oh yeah, that's going to be up there. Yeah, [00:20:33] Sundi: yeah, just like a last note, if your, if your company happens to be offering any kind of training [00:20:37] Sundi: budget, uh, please, please ask. The worst they can say is no, no one's going to yell at you for asking. Just go ahead and ask. [00:20:44] David: absolutely.[00:20:45] Sundi: you there. [00:20:46] David: Yeah, most def. Um, and those prices we just rattled off to, like they will increase a bit, you know, past, um, July 31st. So whenever that is going to expire, it doesn't increase a ton, not relatively anyway, but if you wanted to save a little money and you knew that you needed to go, go, you[00:21:09] David: know, go ahead and buy the ticket, book the rooms.[00:21:11] David: Especially book the rooms. [00:21:13] Owen: if you're listening to this podcast on the day [00:21:15] Owen: that it comes out, you've got about a week before the prices go up a little bit [00:21:19] Owen: on the [00:21:19] Owen: conference. So, so yeah, get in there.[00:21:22] Sundi: Go get your tickets. Um, so, talks. Or, why don't we go training first? Because training happens before talks. So, uh, what trainings are going to be available? How does training normally go? And has anyone here gone to a training?[00:21:38] David: No.[00:21:41] Sundi: you haven't?[00:21:42] Mark: I have not been to[00:21:43] David: Crickets. I floated through training [00:21:46] David: classes like I was there. I creepily watched them from across the room, but, [00:21:51] Mark: You're like, can I just [00:21:52] Mark: audit [00:21:53] David: didn't actually, yeah, didn't actually like sit down and pay any money or, You know, You know, like actually attend. I was just, I was just aware of what was going on and got to talk to folks while they're kind of taking breaks in between sessions. [00:22:06] Sundi: Oh, and have you attended one?[00:22:08] Owen: it looks like there's a lot of practical stuff happening. So [00:22:10] Owen: I've not attended training, the only one.[00:22:13] Owen: at ElixirConf. So wait, what, what training did you attend?[00:22:17] Sundi: It was, Bruce Tate's, um, uh, you know, honestly, this was 2019. I don't remember what the subject specifically was, but it was, it felt like, um, one of those intro to Elixir classes. It was one of those classes where I finally got it, you know, like, I had been kind of muddling around in Elixir at work, learning Elixir for the first time, and then two months in, my manager was like, Hey, you're going to this conference, you're going to training.[00:22:41] Sundi: This is the thing. And I was like, okay, [00:22:43] Mark: Sweet. [00:22:44] Owen: Was there[00:22:45] Owen: like one or two things that, that Bruce did that you would wish that every, every trainer would do?[00:22:51] Sundi: everything that Bruce does, [00:22:53] Owen: I'm taking notes. [00:22:53] Sundi: I literally, every time somebody is like, I'm struggling with pickling or pickling. Oh my gosh. Well, if you want pickling now, anytime somebody says that they're struggling with, um, a concept or just like picking up Elixir, Because Groxio worked so well for me and how I learn and I've gone back, you know, I've done LiveView courses with Bruce also.[00:23:12] Sundi: I've also had some of my direct reports go take some of the Groxio classes and they always came back saying, you know, they are having a better understanding of The subject matter, there's OTP ones, there's LiveView specific ones. It's two or three days in the, in those cases. Uh, in, in ElixirConf, it's, it's gonna be like, uh, five hours roughly.[00:23:33] Sundi: Um, but for me, it, I think it was the biggest, it was the biggest aha moment I ever had in my Elixir journey, which was, um, just really explaining things without this idea that you already know what, you know, like sometimes someone is explaining something to you and they have this air of, well, you know, this, this part.[00:23:54] Sundi: So what we're just trying to get at is this part. And you're like, no, I didn't get that at all. So now I'm very lost. Um, I didn't get that at all with Bruce and I wish trainers would take the time and, and, and find out what you do know before moving on with your subjects. Uh, Bruce always, always checks in with where you are, and I, these training classes are kind of smaller depending on how many people are in it, so he, he had the ability to do that.[00:24:16] Sundi: And, um, for other folks who are trading, I, I hope they get to do that, something like that as well.[00:24:20] Owen: Yeah, engineers never presume knowledge, right? [00:24:24] Owen: So, yeah, I think what's interesting about training, classes. I went through a very kind of multi week training process at a previous job a long time ago in customer service. Some of the, , really nice takeaways I had from that were, yeah, not presuming any knowledge, like, everyone needs to start from the same ground level and build up from there.[00:24:45] Owen: Some people would have additional skills, but they would help each other out as well. Checking in with people, giving plenty of breaks and being clear and, like, repeating concepts, especially when they're new, so that, they sink in. tackling things from a couple of different perspectives sometimes.[00:24:59] Owen: And [00:25:00] then, like, practice. There's like absorption mode and there's also like, do it mode, I think that's the exciting part actually trying to craft a training class for a day is a, how much can we cover of the, of the topic that I'm, that I want to cover.[00:25:14] Owen: And then, am I delivering my message clearly enough that people can pick up and keep up with this? [00:25:21] David: I think that repetition is the mother of memory. I'm sure that's a big saying somewhere. So while you're there repeating the thing several times, that's a technique, but mostly, you know, a lot of developers will read a lot of documentation. They have a lot of theory in their mind, don't actually practice it.[00:25:39] David: And then when it comes to actually like applying some of those principles, it becomes, it's difficult. It's difficult to do that. From just theory, these training classes are breaking that paradigm, forcing you to actually do it with your actual fingers, , to create the thing.[00:25:54] David: And I think that's, that is like when I was in school, I didn't, I never went back to my notes that I wrote. I just had to write the notes. Like that was it. Never. I almost never went back to my notes. It's just, it was just a way of practicing [00:26:08] Mark: well the process [00:26:08] Mark: of writing is a way of ingraining, Yeah. [00:26:13] Owen: That's the, so that's the fun part about doing training, so I've like done talks now and I rehearse, you know, I used to be a musician. And so, like, I rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. Imagine, like, there's an audience in front of me. That way, whenever I get on stage, it's not, you know, it helps me with my nerves.[00:26:24] Owen: So, Uh, I know not, not everyone practices. Some people write their slides the night before, and I can't imagine operating that way. But, uh, yeah, there's like, I think, you know, the plan is like, I'm going to do a kind of a mini version of this remotely, but there's not like a, a really a full way to, to practice a training class. At least the way it's going to be at ElixirConf, because, you know, there will be a group of people in this room for the first time, so we'll be a little bit winging it, but you know, hopefully we'll be well enough prepared, uh, to actually, you know, Deliver some useful tidbits. [00:27:00] Just a long mob pairing session.[00:27:03] David: Well, so we've talked about it, but have you, have you actually said what you're doing? [00:27:07] Owen: Right. Okay. So, yeah, so myself [00:27:10] Owen: and one of my coworkers here at SmartLogic Charles from our team, Charles Suggs will be my co trainer. , we're going to lead a workshop on building maintainable, LiveView components, so we're going to do everything from like the, the, some of the stuff you see in [00:27:25] Owen: core components. If we're gonna think about like, alright, this is like a nice starting point. How do we wanna like change what we see in here? Do we want to reorganize it? Rethink how some of the things that were being done in that module, uh, we're going to maybe kind of build some new components that aren't in there.[00:27:42] Owen: Like maybe like dropdowns, maybe something I was building today.[00:27:47] Owen: Uh,[00:27:48] Owen: uh, more advanced components like live components and maybe some like even embedded LiveView. , things that are that act like a component because I need to maintain their own state. So, those are some of the things I'm working on this week, uh, kind of between projects. So, that's the preparation we're doing right now. We've gone through and brainstormed and have like a rough outline of what we think we can do within the day.[00:28:11] Nice. [00:28:12] Owen: yeah, so that's that's kind of where we're at. And yeah, hopefully in a few weeks, we'll be able to do a trial run internally [00:28:19] Owen: and then be ready to go for August 27th. [00:28:23] David: Heh heh [00:28:25] Sundi: it's nice having a partner, right? Like to bounce ideas off of and everything. I find it's easier to prepare, you know, when it's not just you and your head, but you with a real person. Um, this, this might be the earliest I've, this might be the most on track I have felt with getting slides prepared for ElixirConf.[00:28:45] Sundi: We're like halfway, we're almost completely done with our [00:28:48] Sundi: our rough draft and now it's kind of [00:28:49] Sundi: designing the fun stuff. Yeah, it's crazy,[00:28:52] David: Oh, very nice. don't set the bar too high. You gotta leave a little room for spontaneity, too. That's [00:29:00] Sundi: Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. Well, [00:29:02] Sundi: uh, we're going to do a test [00:29:03] Sundi: run tomorrow, so we'll see how that goes. [00:29:06] David: five minutes of dad jokes. Just full on Sundi style dad jokes. [00:29:13] Owen: [00:29:14] Owen: They'll be Pokemon jokes.[00:29:15] Sundi: I'll take [00:29:16] David: Okay. [00:29:17] Sundi: dad jokes.[00:29:18] David: All right. Well, uh, so there's a lot of training courses going on. You mentioned yours, of course. I'm very excited about that. It's in person, by the way. It's not virtual, [00:29:29] Sundi: I think there's virtual training offered,[00:29:30] Sundi: though. [00:29:32] Owen: Well, [00:29:32] David: There is. [00:29:33] Owen: yeah, so our class will be in person. I don't know. I think there's some of these classes will be [00:29:40] Owen: both. There's some of the classes are virtual. David, do you know,[00:29:45] David: One of them is done, one of them, one of them is done, in person and virtually. But past that one, the rest of them are either only virtual or only in person. Um, so you have the unlock the power of LiveView native, [00:30:00] which is, in person, , that's Brooklyn Meyers and Brian Cardarella. No surprise there. I'm sure that'll be good. , you got instrumenting Elixir applications. That's the one where it is both in person and, or virtual, training class. That's going to be a good one. Instrumenting, last I remember I looked at it. I think that's going to be a lot about, open telemetry, which is great.[00:30:19] Sundi: No biases there, but I'm just [00:30:21] Sundi: going to throw it out there. Ethan and Zach are great. You're going to learn a lot if you want to go to that one.[00:30:26] David: oh, right. That's, uh, okay. Yeah. A little represent in there. And that's, [00:30:31] Mark: Well, I just want to interject right here just because [00:30:33] Mark: what's interesting is the virtual classes are held on Friday, August the 23rd. So like that instrumenting Elixir applications, there's going to be two times that that class is being held. So it's going to be held virtually and then a separate one for in person.[00:30:48] Mark: So, cause I, I imagine it would be very difficult as someone who's running it to try and manage the people who are virtual and the people who are in front of you. You know, trying to keep on top of all that. So, Yeah, so so all the virtual classes, you could [00:31:01] Mark: attend those on Friday, August the 23rd. [00:31:03] David: yeah, There is another training class about enriching your videos with AI. So lots of interweaving a bunch of domains. That sounds pretty interesting. That's gonna be by the Software Mansion folks, the folks that do, Membrane, I believe. That'll be in person, kind of surprised that they're coming a long way, but I'm very happy for that.[00:31:22] David: Uh, yours, of course, Owen, and then, uh, also Ash Framework, um, Zach Daniel, who's, uh, somewhat local, and then Josh Price over uh, [00:31:32] Sundi: Very not local. [00:31:33] Sundi: Very, [00:31:33] Sundi: very,[00:31:34] David: Very not local. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, fun guy to talk to though. So Ash, Ash Framework, they're doing a class on that. , , they're from Alembic, putting that on.[00:31:43] David: And then there's several of the virtual ones. We already talked about a couple. There's another one that is LiveView Deep Dive. One of the class, one of the few classes is actually run by one person at least according to the agenda here. Um, and then lastly, you mentioned Bruce Tate. He's doing a virtual class as well, and this is machine learning tapas.[00:32:01] David: Three Elixir AI appetizers [00:32:02] David: appetizers [00:32:04] David: which will be pretty interesting. [00:32:05] Sundi: Definitely won't walk away hungry. [00:32:08] David: See, five minutes of that in your talk and you'll, you'll do great. [00:32:12] Owen: You know, when, so I know each of us here has given a talk and you've probably given a talk at the same [00:32:17] Owen: time as a talk you wanted to attend. I'm having the same experience now. I want to go to all these training classes.[00:32:24] Sundi: You could go to one on Friday. [00:32:26] Owen: Right, well, okay, so here's a sneak peek.[00:32:29] Owen: My, my plans are I'm going to Miami for a few days before the conference. I might be too chilled out to actually absorb anything, but I'll, I'll see. I'll, [00:32:40] David: Miami, a chill out. Chill out's going to happen in [00:32:43] David: Miami. Miami's not a chill out place, man. [00:32:45] Owen: Well, I've never been, [00:32:46] Owen: so maybe I'm way off, but the, the plan is to chill. Maybe [00:32:50] Owen: I'll, uh, maybe I won't be as chill as I thought. Right, right. [00:32:55] Mark: You can be sitting on the beach with the Mai Tai, with your [00:32:57] Mark: laptop there, watching, headphones in.[00:33:00] Mark: Yeah, Yeah. right. Okay. Yeah, I can see that. Sorry. I judged. [00:33:04] Sundi: And then of course [00:33:05] Sundi: we've got a really huge lineup of talks as, as we usually do. I'm, I'm actually really excited that I don't know a lot of these people. I love meeting new people and I love hearing from new people and new perspectives. Um, it's one of my favorite things about being on this podcast, you know, just getting to chat with so many people and [00:33:23] Sundi: I don't know so many of these names.[00:33:27] David: a lot of good familiar faces too. Hermann Valesko's done some. I've done one. Christopher Granger. Chris Granger, you know, has done one. Charlie Holtz has done one last year. Brooklyn Myers has done one last year. Uh, you know, there's, there are, there are a good mixture of familiar folks, but it is, like, remarkably good, like, to see a fresh mix of them as well.[00:33:49] David: It's not, it's not ElixirConf's 2021 control C control V. You know, it's not copy paste. Yeah,[00:34:00] Owen: or[00:34:02] Owen: are could provide the link in the show notes [00:34:04] Sundi: below. Owen's not,[00:34:07] David: there are simply too many to go over here. There, there are so many though. So, but I will point out though, you are, um, you are giving your training class, but then you're also giving a talk. So you're kind of doing this stuff twice.[00:34:19] Owen: am I, no, I, oh, there's a section of trainers, so, [00:34:25] Owen: yeah, it's, it's not a talk,[00:34:27] Owen: but it's, Owen. [00:34:28] Owen: there's a section of [00:34:30] Owen: trainers. Like, I,[00:34:32] Mark: Sundi's got a talk. Yeah. no. [00:34:36] Sundi: Yeah, me and, um, my colleague Christian Cook are [00:34:40] Sundi: giving a talk on how to get a promotion. That is not the title of the talk. We decided on a very, you know, fun, fun. What is it? It's so many words. I can't even,[00:34:50] Mark: Engineering your promotion for Elixirists, a practical guide to career advancement. [00:34:54] Sundi: Yeah, we wanted[00:34:55] Sundi: to make it sound like a storybook. Anyways, we have strong feelings on the subject [00:35:00] and, , as an engineering manager, , I will work with, , people all the time on leveling up their careers. There are some specific advantages I've, I've found, , as an Elixir pro that you can, you could do particularly with the community, but also just like opportunities that are out there.[00:35:15] Sundi: I did mention the market sucks this year, so I don't know that, um, That it'll all apply. , but yeah, we're really excited to give this talk and, uh, I'm looking forward to sharing that and meeting everyone who wants to talk about that.[00:35:29] Owen: exciting. I really love technical talks, but career minded talks are also very, very useful because, are people coming into this as like their first job and some people who might have, been operating for a couple of decades,[00:35:44] Owen: if not an Elixir, you know, in other languages.[00:35:46] I think there's a lot to learn there.[00:35:48] Sundi: My, my personal goal that I hope comes out of the talk is I would love to see some folks in the room who are looking for mentorship, find a mentor in the community. Whether they walk out of that room and their mentor is the person they sat next to, or somebody they meet in the hallway track, doesn't have to be anything formal, but I find that's a question I get the most often.[00:36:11] Sundi: And when they ask, like, how did you find your mentor? Where did you find a mentor? How do you even approach that conversation? I usually say, well, maybe there's somebody here. You know, uh, who wouldn't mind chatting with you every other month or so just to see what you've done recently.[00:36:27] Sundi: That's not, you know, part of your org because that can be a biased mentorship, um, or very like, you know, you, your org could do something very specifically one way and you could, you learn from other folks who do things another way. I always find that very beneficial. So my own hope for that is that we see some more mentorship coming out of ElixirConf.[00:36:47] Mark: One thing I want to call out there is you, dear listener, may not be thinking of yourself as a mentor. Like, Oh, I couldn't be a mentor. And really, I like to think of it, As like a highway with a bunch of cars traveling on it. If you are two or three car lengths ahead of the person behind you, you've already experienced more, right?[00:37:09] Mark: And. You don't have to be like the guru, the one that has all the answers on the top of the mountain. No, you don't, you don't have to do that. You just being willing to help somebody else out, give them a little bit of advice, like Sundi was saying, being able to just say, I can look at some of your code on a periodic basis, you know, and I'm not going to, you're not committing to, pair programming every day with them.[00:37:29] Mark: It's nothing like that. Right. Just like being able to. Field some questions, like, Hey, I'm stuck on something. How do I figure out what to[00:37:35] Mark: do with this? Just, you can be a mentor. Ha ha. [00:37:44] David: how to zipper merge all the things, how to carry this metaphor through. [00:37:50] Owen: Well, even if you don't find a quote unquote mentor, you will find some highly opinionated friends who will be happy to share their thoughts on any topic.[00:38:00] Sundi: You will, in fact, find that whether you want to or not at ElixirConf, there are opinions. Embrace the opinions.[00:38:10] David: Yeah. I do want to highlight that you say that and, there were a couple of talks where I'm I, I was very resistant about, I was like, I don't think this is, this is not going to be any good. And I, and I listened to it, I'm like. Crap, now I'm challenged. Like, like, like, dang it.[00:38:28] David: Um, and, and it's, it's honestly some of those talks where I, I continue to think about it. It's that little mind worm, you know, just like I could, it, it festered even more in a good way though. Like, you know, in a way that it just kind of made me continue to think about it and, and, and create my own opinion about it.[00:38:47] David: know why I believe the things that I believed versus, you know, what was handed to me in some conference talk. , and it wasn't more like I'm solidifying my own opinion. It was like, no, it actually, it actually made me understand the other perspective a little bit more and not, not be so, you know, You know, opinionated in my own little things.[00:39:06] David: Uh, and I'm, I am literally talking about Elixir though, cause you can kind of apply that to anything that, you know, it's a life lessons, but, um, but it does happen in tech circles as well. That's my point, I guess. Uh, and those are. Honestly, some of the fun ones to go to because of that, because you just continue to think about it.[00:39:25] David: And then you realize that it's not such a big deal anyway. And then you get to talk to the, to the guy or to the girl. And then, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's just people, man. You know, like, like this, it ain't that big of a deal. Like we're all, we're all still trying to figure this out and we're all, and most of all, I think we're all just trying to enjoy it.[00:39:43] David: Um, and. I definitely see that a lot when I go to ElixirConf. I see a lot of folks that really enjoy what they're doing, and I get to see that passion come out more than anything else. That's why sometimes these talks, I don't really care about what they're talking about, but I [00:40:00] love seeing all of the energy around it.[00:40:02] David: And all the, you know, like why they care about that. Like, why, why should I care more about testing? You know, I, and I, I get to learn from Herman Valeska about why that matters so much to him, because he's found like his rhythm, he found like a good way to speed up his development process, all that kind of stuff.[00:40:17] David: And I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have known that if he didn't carry that energy, you know? [00:40:22] Sundi: Yeah, I think even listening to somebody who's very passionate about something, , even in non tech terms, if they're very passionate about a thing and they're just telling me about it, I'm just like, Wow, it is so much fun to hear you talk about this thing because you love this thing so much. And I have never thought more than, or I've never thought about it once, just never.[00:40:45] David: Yeah. [00:40:45] Owen: It leaves an impression because like when you, Sundi, are like, uh, we need an engineer, even if it's not about the particular topic that they were talking about, you will have, , heard how they communicate, how they express their thoughts, and all the thoughts that kind of went into that. And like that person might be on your radar, so that's always handy.[00:41:06] Owen: I think another fun thing to do when you're attending ElixirConf, even if you're not is to think of, challenging yourself. So are there ideas that you're having as you listen to other talks or out in the hallway or just when you're kind of decompressing, are there ideas that you have about things that you would like to talk about as well?[00:41:24] Owen: Like, would you like to present something about, I don't know, components, , pass keys, I don't know, anything. [00:41:32] Sundi: You're definitely not interested [00:41:33] Owen: do I talk about that? Nah, never thought about them before[00:41:36] Owen: in my life. Very passionate. you give that talk, you get to be badgered by one of your favorite podcast hosts about, about,[00:41:43] Owen: uh, WebAuth and, , yeah.[00:41:47] Owen: Attending as a, as a, as a speaker is fun. And then also just kind of like just absorbing things as an attendee [00:41:55] Sundi: Yeah. [00:41:56] Owen: super fun.[00:41:57] Sundi: Um, we have in one of our Slack channels where we like chat about our talk ideas at work, we have a, um, countdown to Elixir. It's not at all stressful. It pings the channel and it's like, all right, countdown to 26 August, this is how many days left?[00:42:14] Sundi: And you're like, oh, great. And just pings the whole channel every Monday.[00:42:20] Mark: That's funny.[00:42:21] Sundi: Yeah. It's the channel where we're, we're, uh, trying to make sure our talks are ready.[00:42:26] Mark: Uh, yeah.[00:42:28] Owen: Well, speaking of talks, are there themes? I mean, I've seen some themes running through these talks. Are there some that stand out to guys? Maybe Mark?[00:42:38] Mark: Just looking through the talks, like there's, there's a number of them that are, you know, you see things about data processing. It's, you see a theme of nerves and nerves is always one of those things. Like, I would love to play more with that. I just don't have, I'm not dedicated.[00:42:51] Mark: I'm not willing to dedicate the time right now. Right. But nerves is so cool. I remember watching Justin Snek's demo of, , Nerves Hub, right? And it's like, wow, that is so cool. That was just neat. Uh, but yeah, so I mean, there's, I see, you know, there's machine learning stuff.[00:43:08] Mark: There's, there's lots of different tracks or topics that you could say you want to focus on. Sa?a Juric he's going to be talking about folding the umbrella, about project structure, right? So, I mean, we know of umbrella projects and they were very popular for a time. And now they seem, I don't know, they seem not popular.[00:43:27] Mark: I want to know what Sa?a has to take on that. He's always got an interesting take.[00:43:31] Sundi: And, um, Owen's usually talking about ETLs, but this time David is. [00:43:37] David: Boom. Yeah. Oh, it's actually a lot of folks are, um, but I think there's a good, there's going to be a good like delineation of which one you might want to go to. Like I'll be talking about ETLs in the small. It's, honestly, I'm kind of like, I'm not going to say this very positively about my talk, but I'm kind of, I'm kind of ripping off a couple other talks and combining them into one, right?[00:44:00] David: That have like really impacted me and how I think about this kind of stuff. And it's naming the, extract transform load, and it's, it's kind of stealing that term and, and applying it to the small, you know, when you think about ETLs, it's like, the first thing you think of is, Man, now I got, I got Datalakes, Databricks, Snowflakes, and Snowlakes, and all this, you know, like, Broadways, and Kafka's, and all these words that start to not mean anything, you know, and Google, and Apple, and I'm not any of those.[00:44:32] David: It's, it's, it's so easy to just kind of balloon and think that it's something so large. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep it in the small, so that, that's, that's mine. But there's, there's, There's like two, at least two other talks here of, Miki Rezentes, a co worker of mine, is doing, is talking about Ecto multis and Oban.[00:44:50] David: Of course, Parker Selbert will be there to talk about Oban. , all of that has to do with processing data. You've got Reed Morrison talking about leveraging Broadway. [00:45:00] Um, to parallelize, uh, Kafka stuff. So there's definitely some, you know, big ETL stuff going on there. Um, you know, there's, there's, um, there's another one on here too.[00:45:11] David: Uh, there's Chris, Chris Granger's talks on data frames are not just for data scientists. And I don't, I don't know if he's talking about ETLs, but data frames is about a lot of data and making sense of that. So like, he's going to be touching on that. You know, there's, there's Chris Bailey talking about scaling past joins, a framework for.[00:45:28] David: Kind of materialized views, but on the application side. So a lot of data there, you know, messaging with limits, concurrent multi stage data, processing in the real world by Brian Meeker. Oh my gosh. So much stuff about, you know, um, uh, about processing data. I, I, uh, this is the last thing I'll say. I'll shut up.[00:45:47] David: But Elixir is so good at this and like, it stuck in my head like two or three years ago. We went, we went to ElixirConf when LiveView came out and the whole thing was about LiveView. The whole conference was about LiveView, which was amazing. It is groundbreaking, but like, but I, I, I, I remember walking away from that and really being impacted by Broadway the most.[00:46:14] David: Broadway, um, I, I can't remember his name, but, uh, another person that used to be at, , Plataformatec, gave the talk about Broadway and visualize it, and I was just blown away, but the whole conference was about LiveView, so, uh, uh, all that to say, uh, too, is that I, I, I'm glad that LiveView The conference this year is much more balanced in all of its talks, but I am happy, uh, to see that we are leaning into some of the strengths [00:46:42] Sundi: I'm so excited. [00:46:44] Owen: Yes, yeah, I'm, I'm also seeing some really interesting talk. So, yeah, we've got definitely some LiveView stuff happening. , I'm seeing a couple of talks about music and video processing. Those are very interesting. Building Africa's water and sanitation information network. Sounds Amazing. [00:47:02] Sundi: I want to hear that so much,[00:47:04] David: Yeah. [00:47:05] Owen: , we started on FarmBot and now we're talking about like an entire ecosystem of water with Elixir.[00:47:10] Owen: That's, wild. Of course there'll be some AI, but I think maybe a little bit less than last year. So there's, [00:47:17] Sundi: which is almost surprising [00:47:19] Sundi: To hear less AI this year than last year because of how much more AI is in our face now.[00:47:25] Owen: Hmm.[00:47:26] Mark: Well, I will say, I had planned to give a presentation on AI at ElixirConf. And then, so I was totally on board. I was super excited about it. It's all about agents and having, you know, these asynchronous workers that kind of act on your behalf with whatever directives you give them and the permissions you grant them.[00:47:47] Mark: Uh, but then I, I set off on my own. The timing was right. And I've started, I'm fully dedicated into this startup, which, you know, is using AI as, as part of it. Uh, but, uh, because of that and just like this whole idea of like, wow, I, I really feel the pressure to get this up and going and, and running that I had to back out from actually attending and presenting because I just couldn't.[00:48:13] Mark: Focus to, to give the, really what I wanted to put into it for the presentation. So that's my unfortunate sadness there.[00:48:21] Sundi: We're sad we won't see you, but I'm honestly very glad that you mentioned that because a lot of people wouldn't do that. Like, I've, I've known several people who wanted to go for something very badly and tried to take on everything. That they had going and they didn't know how to let go. I am definitely one of those people who will try to take on everything. , and honestly, being self aware of what you can handle and what you want to focus on, like where you want to prioritize your time is, is like such a big thing. And I actually, that's like a whole section of slides, just a little preview, whole section of[00:48:57] Mark: Yeah. I mean, there are, there are books about this, right? Just the, uh, the ability to say no to things. Right. And like, if you hear Steve Jobs talk, he'd say like, you know, you can have a thousand ideas, but it's all the things you say no to that matter about what you end up with. So, yeah.[00:49:15] Owen: Actually, that is a such a pro segue to, I was looking at the keynotes[00:49:20] Owen: and Jose's keynote is the projects that. [00:49:24] Owen: never were. [00:49:25] Sundi: didn't see that. [00:49:29] David: Oh, we, Yeah. [00:49:30] Owen: There's a synergy happening here. [00:49:32] David: I didn't see that we [00:49:33] David: had titles here.[00:49:34] David: Okay,[00:49:35] Mark: For, [00:49:44] Owen: Like, why? Like, why? Like, yeah, we, it's not going to be a surprise. [00:49:47] Sundi: I think it'll be a woodworking Keynote.[00:49:49] Owen: Yeah. Right. Right. [00:49:50] David: He just, just brings out his saw, [00:49:52] Sundi: Yeah, this is how this birdhouse turned out. I'm pretty sure this was with a Keynote. I'm putting it in now. That's [00:49:57] Sundi: my prediction. [00:49:58] Owen: yeah, yeah, [00:50:00] so it probably has nothing to do with, uh, any Phoenix stuff [00:50:03] Sundi: The projects[00:50:04] Sundi: that never were. That's so fun. I am so excited for that.[00:50:09] Mark: yeah. So he just describes it as at DashBit, we have started and co maintained several projects to move the Elixir community forward, GenStage, Broadway, Req, Nx, LiveBook, and more. However, there are also several projects we discussed in the past. And build proof of concepts for, but ultimately decide not to move forward with, and then it takes a look at what those are.[00:50:29] Mark: So yeah, it's either you realize maybe this doesn't need to be its own independent library. It's not that significant or big enough. I don't know. Like,[00:50:38] Sundi: How do you make that decision? exactly. [00:50:40] Owen: better [00:50:40] Owen: yet, someone else can build it, right? I don't want to do this. I'll just float it and someone else will[00:50:45] Just nerd snipe someone else into it.[00:50:47] Owen: Yes, the whole community.[00:50:49] Sundi: Yeah, Jose is always, always saying, if you want that thing, go, go, go out there and be the, be the difference you want to see in the world. Build the thing. Because people are always asking him for stuff. He's like, you, you can build it.[00:51:00] David: The, the, the only one I'm aware of that didn't, work out, was BytePak. [00:51:04] Mark: Hmm. [00:51:06] David: You remember BytePak? [00:51:07] Mark: it's [00:51:07] Mark: the idea of being[00:51:08] Mark: able to, pay for private repositories of packages. Yeah.[00:51:12] David: right, I guess you could say a spiritual successor, probably no real connection, I have no idea, but a spiritual successor would have been Code, Codeship or something like that. It kind of does that same, thing, now and across ecosystems. But yeah, man, ooh, that's going to be good. I'm curious. That's an ideas kind of talk, like one that's going to have you spinning for a bit. that's going to be [00:51:33] David: good. [00:51:33] Sundi: huh. [00:51:34] Owen: We've got some other new names here as well. So Justin Schneck, he's given keynotes before. So he's got one about, , life and logic. So human in the loop, life and logic in the era of biointegrated computation. Sounds, uh, sciency. [00:51:51] David: Biointegrated like computation. Is that [00:51:54] Owen: Well, [00:51:54] Owen: yeah. Does that mean, well, yeah, is it like a medical devices? Is it like [00:51:59] Owen: chip in the [00:51:59] Owen: brain or is it like farm bio? Who knows? Like bio means so many different things, but yeah. So that one looks cool. Uh, we got our YouTube influencer, Twitch influencer, Theo,[00:52:14] Mark: Mm hmm.[00:52:15] Owen: who made a splash by highly praising Phoenix and LiveView a few weeks ago. So he'll be giving a keynote. [00:52:22] Sundi: Yeah, we'll have to leave a, we'll have to leave a link to some of those videos. I think those are pretty cool.[00:52:27] Owen: Yes. Yeah. And then, uh, Ellie Fairholme and Josep (Pep) Giralt D'Lacoste sorry if I, if I butchered that, but, uh, they're also talking about, engineering Elixir applications. If you don't deploy it, it ain't real. And that is 100 percent true.[00:52:44] David: Yeah, It's[00:52:46] Sundi: definitely not real if all you did was buy the domain name, for those of you who had to hear that today.[00:52:52] David: yeah, never done that. No.[00:52:54] Mark: Yeah, we we've had them both on, to talk with us. And so they were the ones who were talking about, , BeamOps,[00:53:01] [00:53:01] Mark: uh, which is like DevOps around the Beam applications, not just Elixir, but Erlang as well. Just, you know, how do I, Deploy and maintain a Beam application. So yeah, very cool. Interesting to see what they have to say.[00:53:13] Sundi: Yeah.[00:53:14] Mark: And Chris McCord's keynote is still TBD. We don't know at the time of this recording what that's going to be. But he usually drops some kind of bombshell. Like maybe that's when LiveView 1. 0 will be, launched or announced or something like that. [00:53:28] Sundi: Oh god, I hope so.[00:53:30] Owen: Let's see, we are at release candidate number six, so it's got to be [00:53:35] David: it's got to be [00:53:36] Owen: conference day, right? Like he's going to hit, you know, hex. publish on stage.[00:53:41] Sundi: I hope he does [00:53:42] Sundi: that. That would be great. [00:53:44] Mark: And that will be right when his wifi goes down and it'll just be,[00:53:48] Owen: No, we get, yeah, 30 more minutes of dad jokes because the projector goes offline or [00:53:53] Owen: something.[00:53:54] Sundi: Well, I think this will be one of the most fun years, um, and it would be only more fun if Mark would be there. [00:54:02] Mark: Oh man, I wish I could. [00:54:03] Sundi: But other than[00:54:04] Sundi: that, it'll be one of the most fun years.[00:54:06] Mark: But one of the things I want to highlight is just in the past, the conference, the keynotes have always been released first and like, they're not held back very long. Those, uh, are released usually pretty soon. So if for whatever reason, you're not able to attend, some of those big keynotes are going to be available pretty soon and we, which we really appreciate and then eventually some of the other, , talks that you're maybe really interested in seeing.[00:54:33] Mark: Those will be released. So the virtual way is the way to get, like, if you are really interested in that topic, that's the best way if you can't physically be there. But if you're interested in the whole aspect of networking, connecting with people, just geeking out over cool things like Elixir or just whatever you happen to care about, and you connect with somebody who's a kindred spirit, who loves You know, the, I don't know, Dragon Balls, Pokemon, [00:55:00] Integration Mesh, you know, something they're, they're, they're everywhere, right?[00:55:05] Mark: Just people who have interesting, unusual ideas and, and, uh, passions. And so yeah, you'll find [00:55:11] Mark: great people to connect with. [00:55:13] David: Yeah. The virtual ticket will also get you access to that platform, by the way. So if it's like, if it's totally just a scheduling thing and you can't make it right on those days, you can still pick up the ticket, the virtual ticket. And get instant access to those recordings. And you won't have to wait so long, personally.[00:55:31] David: And given the prices of those tickets, , not that it's a charity, but. You know, you are, you are supporting the Elixir community at that point, but, and also getting the benefit of getting those talks early, , because a lot of these topics, they age, , some of the talks from like 2016 are still applicable today, but all of these like specific ones about libraries, about, you know, Like, you know, things that are, that are just old at this point, eh, it's not really that helpful anymore, you know?[00:55:56] David: So these are, these are talks that are, are going to be, relevant to, to, us for the next like couple of years, but maybe not past that. At least when they're about specific things. [00:56:06] Sundi: For sure.[00:56:08] Owen: So critically, uh, you know, we had Lazy River because, you know, the other resort had Lazy River. They had, you know, falconers. So are we, are there, are we going to be like riding dolphins and whales or like, how does this work at SeaWorld Resort? Yeah. Yeah. So if you haven't heard, this is at SeaWorld on a resort, , hotel somewhere on SeaWorld. So, uh, it's, it's relatively close to Disney World as well. If you'd rather go there, you're totally welcome to the, SeaWorld would, would be much more convenient. I think it'd be like across the street though.[00:56:43] David: Um, Yeah, I don't, I don't know what fun things. I don't know if we're gonna see, you know, like Free Willy musicals on the stage or not. Or like Flipper, you know, I don't think, I don't know if Flipper will come up on stage. Like who, who knows? I, I am prepared to be surprised. There's always something. But, but I, I am for sure, a lot of folks out there that are traveling in, a lot of the cost is the travel.[00:57:12] David: So, if you're on the fence about, like, booking an extra night, just, just one night, man, just one night.[00:57:20] Owen: Spend the night at David's house. [00:57:22] David: Give yourself an extra day. And give yourself permission to go to SeaWorld, just, just one day. You don't have to make a whole weekend of it. Uh, cause, you know, it's nice to relax.[00:57:32] David: Nice to not think about Elixir too every once in a while, you know? Just, just chill out with some, uh, dolphins and, uh, Sea lions or whatever else they [00:57:41] Sundi: Or with [00:57:41] Sundi: Mickey, because you know, Orlando, [00:57:44] Sundi: right? There's, you know, there's Disney World. There's the every nights of [00:57:48] Sundi: uh, fireworks, which I was surprised to see last year. That was kind of fun.[00:57:53] David: Yeah. it. is a destination to go to. So take advantage of it. [00:57:56] Sundi: hmm, mm hmm. Well, I'm excited. I hope you're excited and I hope everyone else listening is excited and that they're all right now, going to get their tickets for ElixirConf.[00:58:08] Mark: they haven't already, because, you know, half of the people listening right now already have them.[00:58:14] David: You think so? Do [00:58:15] Sundi: That's probably true. I feel like they all probably went in on an early bird as soon as they could get their hands on them.[00:58:22] Owen: I choose to believe that we're responsible for like 80 percent of ticket sales for ElixirConf. So[00:58:27] Owen: for what it's worth, Jim, you [00:58:30] Owen: Awesome. Well, this is great. I can't wait to see you all there. Mark, you're going to have to like, David's going to walk around with a, like an iPad, you know, you know, robot form or whatever. So we're gonna have to see you there virtually.[00:58:46] Mark: Yep. Awesome. Woohoo![00:58:49] Sundi: cool. See you all there.[00:58:51] Owen: See you in Orlando. [00:58:53] David: there. [00:58:55] Sundi: Hey friends! This just in. If you are listening to this episode, you have 50 off to ElixirConf for 2024. Please use code ELIXIRPODCAST at checkout and you'll get $50 off to your ticket for ElixirConf this year in Orlando, Florida. Hope to see you there!
