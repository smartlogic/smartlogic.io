      <blockquote cite="/podcast/elixir-wizards/s5e8-nowack-heinz/">
        You don't have to convince your company to make a wholesale switch to Elixir if you can just deploy something — something that adds value and you can get people using that. You can make an incremental change.</blockquote> <cite>— Shaun Robinson in <a href="/podcast/elixir-wizards/s5e13-robinson-billups/">S5E13 on Using Elixir to Empower Online Learning</a></cite>
