      <h2>Season Eleven: Branching Out from Elixir</h2>
      <p>
        In Season 11 of the Elixir Wizards podcast, we venture beyond the familiar shores of Elixir to engage in cross-community dialogue, compare notes, and broaden our horizons. This season is dedicated to understanding how Elixir integrates, contrasts, and can potentially synergize with other prominent technologies in the software world.
      </p>

      <p>
        With engaging discussions involving seasoned Elixirists and experts from diverse tech communities such as JavaScript, Ruby, C++, and more, we aim to debunk myths, share insights, and discover mutual learnings. Key conversations revolve around the varied methodologies, best practices, and unique approaches offered by different languages and frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're an Elixir enthusiast curious about the world beyond or a tech professional from another domain eager to explore common ground, this season promises enriching takeaways for all. Dive in to bridge gaps, challenge norms, and celebrate the confluence of ideas in the ever-evolving tech universe.

      <h2>Season Ten: The Next Ten Years of Elixir</h2>
      <p>
        In Season 10 of the Elixir Wizards podcast, we delve into "The Next Ten Years of
        Elixir," exploring the future of DevOps, cyber security, cloud infrastructure,
        and machine learning. This season is a comprehensive exploration of the
        opportunities and challenges Elixir faces in the coming decade.
      </p>

      <p>
        Conversations with industry experts, including Elixir creator José Valim,
        highlight the community's commitment to education, the evolution of Phoenix and
        BEAM, and the advent of types in Elixir. We also discuss the role of tools like
        liveBook and HTTP/3 in the ecosystem's growth.

          The theme for Elixir Wizards Season 9 is "Parsing the Particulars." Hosts Sundi,
          Owen, Dan, and Bilal take a deep dive into the intricacies of Elixir
          development. The Wizards explore critical aspects of the Elixir programming
          language, including: observability, GenServers, geomapping, Phoenix LiveView,
          Oban, Tailwind, and Nerves.

        <p>Our theme in Season Eight is Elixir in a Polyglot Environment. We'll be talking with our guests about how Elixir is used in context with other languages, how they play nicely (or not) together, and how teams manage context switching, constrain complexity, and generally think about how Elixir works within their overal product infrastructure.</p>

        <p>The theme of Season Six was BEAM Magic — taking a look at what gets handled under the hood with Elixir, other languages that run on the BEAM, and talking about how much magic is the right amount — there are a lot of strongly held opinions on this, that are reflected in how much “magic” is included in different programming languages.</p>
        <p>What is hidden by programming languages? How do developers find varying levels of hidden functionality to be alternately useful or problematic — or maybe both! Season Six aired from May - Aug 2021.</p>
