title: "Elixir Wizards Podcast Season Eight: Elixir in a Polyglot Environment"
description: Our theme in Season Eight is Elixir in a Polyglot Environment. We'll be talking with our guests about how Elixir is used in context with other languages, how they play nicely (or not) together, and how teams manage context switching, constrain complexity, and generally think about how Elixir works within their overall product infrastructure.
