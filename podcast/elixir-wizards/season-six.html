title: "Elixir Wizards Podcast Season Six: BEAM Magic"
description: The theme of Season Six was BEAM Magic — taking a look at what gets handled under the hood with Elixir, other languages that run on the BEAM, and talking about how much magic is the right amount — there are a lot of strongly held opinions on this, that are reflected in how much “magic” is included in different programming languages.

        We wanted to build fault tolerant systems, and things are going to go wrong. They always do. You need to just accept the fact things are going to go wrong. How can you build systems that can handle errors?</blockquote> <cite>— Robert Virding in <a href="/podcast/elixir-wizards/s6e1-virding/">S6E1 on The Roots of Erlang</a></cite>
