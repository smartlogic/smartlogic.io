        <h1>Baltimore Women in Tech Micro Grants Program FAQ</h1>
        <h2>What is the purpose of the BWiT micro grant program?</h2>
        <p>SmartLogic launched the BWiT micro grant program to support women in the Baltimore tech community by providing funding to grassroots projects.</p>
        <h2>Who should apply for a microgrant?</h2>
        <p>Applicants should be women (non-binary/transgender are welcome) who have a new or existing tech-related project that will support other women in the Baltimore metro area. We’re looking to help creative ideas get off the ground. Our hope is that a small amount of funding can be the catalyst for converting ideas into action.</p>
        <h2>Who should NOT apply for a microgrant?</h2>
        <p>Grants will not be awarded to organizations with substantial budgets and will not be awarded to for-profit entities.</p>
        <h2>What is the application process?</h2>
        <p>We’ve tried hard to make the application process as simple as possible. Just <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpkOHecx8Jia89pjJavGj26AW671u3y_i-VxKLnQ1Izdeo-w/viewform">submit your application</a> by April 15, 2018. We’ll get back to you by April 25 with our decision.</p>
        <h2>Who is on the selection committee?</h2>
        <p>The selection committee is an <strong>all-women group</strong> of about 7 women that are emerging leaders in the Baltimore tech community. They are a diverse group — some are new to tech and some have been in tech for a few years.</p>
        <h2>How is the money for the micro grant released?</h2>
        <p>We’ll reimburse you for approved expenses as outlined in your grant application. Just keep all your receipts and a log of all expenses, send them to us in an organized manner, and we’ll send you a check within one week. Note that  you do not need to have spent all of your micro grant in order to be reimbursed.</p>
        <h2>How long do I have to finish my project?</h2>
        <p>We understand this probably isn’t your only commitment. However, we do require that you complete your project by October 31, 2017. If you have not completed your project by then, you will forfeit your micro grant.</p>
        <h2>How much money is SmartLogic allotting for this micro grants program?</h2>
        <p>SmartLogic and <a href="https://boldyellow.com/">Bold Yellow</a> are allotting a minimum of $7,000 in grant funding, but the maximum amount an applicant can request for a grant is $1,500.</p>
        <h2>How much money can I request?</h2>
        <p>You can request any amount up to $1,500. Just remember that you will need to provide SmartLogic with valid receipts before you receive the reimbursement.</p>
        <h2>What expenses will the micro grant cover?</h2>
        <p>The micro grant will cover any project expenses except salaries.</p>
        <h2>What can I expect if I receive a micro grant?</h2>
        <p>If you receive a micro grant, you can expect for SmartLogic to maintain steady contact and communication with you. This is to oversee the use of the micro grant money as well as to maintain and strengthen the relationship between SmartLogic and you.</p>
        <h2>I work for a large company, but I’d like to apply for a micro grant for my side project. Can I still apply?</h2>
        <p>Absolutely! As long as your project is your personal project and not a company project, you are welcome and encouraged to apply.</p>
        <h2>How many projects can I submit for funding?</h2>
        <p>You are welcome to submit as many projects for consideration as you’d like. We are open to receiving multiple requests from the same person!</p>
        <h2>I don’t live in the Baltimore area, but I want to organize my project in Baltimore. Can I apply?</h2>
        <p>Yes, provided that your project will support women in tech in the Baltimore metro area. This program is about supporting gender diversity and empowering women within the Baltimore tech community.</p>
        <h2>What do you expect from the report due when my project is complete?</h2>
        <p>The report is simple. It should detail how the grant money was spent, the amount of people impacted by the project, what they learned from their project, and your overall thoughts on the micro grant program.</p>
        <h2>Are there any other terms and conditions?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Please review the <a href="terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>
        <h2>I have another question.</h2>
        <p>We will hold two information sessions where we will answer any and all questions about the program. The first will be virtual (we'll meet via Google Hangouts) and will be held on Monday March 26. The second will be in-person and will be held on Tuesday April 10. Both sessions will be held at 6:30pm. We’ll share the URL for the hangout on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/smartlogic">the @smartlogic twitter account</a> one or two days before the information session. We'll announce the location of the in-person information session a few days ahead of time.</p>
        <p>If you have any further questions please don't hesitate to reach out to <a href="mailto:chelsea@smartlogic.io">email Chelsea Keene</a>.
