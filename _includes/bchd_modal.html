      <p class="overview">The Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) is the oldest continuously-operating health department in the United States.</p>

      <p>SmartLogic worked on BCHD's CHARMcare platform, an open-source directory that guides users to free or low-cost resources in Baltimore. SmartLogic conducted user research and implemented a number of search and usability improvements to CHARMcare, including integrating Elasticsearch, rank-weighting results, geographic filtering, improved tagging, and file uploads.</p>
