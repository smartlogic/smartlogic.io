      <p class="overview">Challenge.Gov is a GSA-run program that allows any federal agency to engage with the public via challenges and prize competitions.</p>

      <p>The new <underline>open-source</underline> platform built by SmartLogic automates previously manual processes, and integrates with GSA TTS systems like Login.gov, Cloud.gov, and Search.gov.</p>

      <p>The Challenge team is now for the first time able to get visibility into how stakeholders are engaging with the program. Additionally, the new self-serve tools have helped the program's adoption to grow and reach new users.</p>
