      <p class="overview">World Central Kitchen (WCK) provides meals to those who need it, in times of crisis and beyond.</p>
      <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, WCK developed a new offering, WCK Direct, that connects households experiencing food insecurity to restaurants.</p>
      <p>SmartLogic built a robust Elixir Phoenix and Flutter app to power the WCK Direct program, supporting the program's growth to additional cities, and improving stability, scale, and usability over their off-the-shelf MVP.</p>
