  <h2>Jobs at SmartLogic</h2>
  <h3><a href="director-of-client-onboarding.html">Now hiring: Director of Client Onboarding</a></h3>
  <p>(We're still hiring smart developers too, of course)</p>
  <section>
    <p>Work for a company that focuses on intelligent simplicity, so you can focus on what you’re best at: coding.</p>
    <p>We're a web and mobile product development company based in Baltimore, MD. We build web and mobile apps in RoR, Javascript, HTML, iOS, and Android. You’ll always be learning and surrounded by smart people.</p>
    <h3>What do we have to offer?</h3>
    <p>We're glad you asked. Here’s a few things that set us apart:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work with other technical people: The principal is a programmer. We have BS/MSE degrees in Computer Science. We know this stuff REALLY well.</li>
      <li>Never drive in rush hour traffic again: You only have to be in the office from 10 am to 3:30 pm. Fill in the rest of your 40 hours when you can. Plus we work remotely every other Friday. You can choose whether to get stuff done in the office, in your favorite coffee shop, or on your couch.</li>
      <li>Kiss stress goodbye: No one does their best work when they’re facing impossible deadlines and screaming project managers. That nonsense simply does not happen here. We have a great process for completing client work, which eases stress and streamlines all operations in the company.</li>
      <li>Go-Go gadget:  Everyone gets a new 27" iMac. We also have about 15 extra 20" monitors in boxes if you'd like to put them to good use...</li>
      <li>Chow down, on us: We’ve got a grocery budget. Just tell us what you want us to keep in stock and we'll get it. Breakfast? Nutella? It’s on. Plus, we provide company lunch once a week. Yum.</li>
      <li>Learn constantly: Our projects typically last several months, which means you’ll quickly gain experience working on several different types of applications.</li>
      <li>Engage with your community: SmartLogic organizes BohConf, Ignite RailsConf, Bmore on Rails, and sponsors tons of community events. Have ideas of what you’d like the company to support? We’re all ears.</li>
      <li>Choose your own team: Our interview process is based on maintaining the best culture for creating excellent technology. You won’t talk to “human resources,” instead, you’ll be interviewed directly by our developers. Before too long, you could be interviewing your next teammate. Work with people you know you can teach--and learn from--because you helped to choose them.</li>
      <li>Escape communication breakdowns: Communication is huge at SmartLogic. We have daily standup meetings, constantly hang out on Campfire, and place a huge emphasis on talking about problems before they become crises.</li>
      <li>Team up: Not only do we talk to each other all the time, we give more than lip service to working together and trading ideas. Beyond regularly pair programming, we hash things out at weekly company lunches, and we even started a quarterly internal conference. Have an idea for the company? With help from your team, you can make it happen.</li>
      <li>Forget about tradeoffs: So, you might be thinking, what’s the tradeoff? None! We offer competitive pay, medical insurance, vacation, all the basics.</li>
      <li>Work in a great environment: We’re dedicated to providing office space that’s aesthetically and intellectually pleasing. We’re currently located in a beautiful office with tons of windows in the Emerging Technology Center, Canton, where we’re surrounded by other technology companies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Important note: We specialize in Ruby on Rails, but many of our developers started at our company with little to no Ruby/Rails experience. We hire smart people and help them gain the correct skills.</p>

    <h3>Don’t believe it? Hear it from our employees. Why I like working at SmartLogic:</h3>
    <p>Paul Ostazeski, Developer</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SLS functions as a meritocracy. Ideas can be tried out, and when they work they stick, and when they don't work they fall by the wayside. (Establishing continuous integration and deployment with borg is a great example).</li>
      <li>Transparency. I never worry about the future health of the company because there isn't any part of the business that is hidden. Yair does a great job of shielding me from the stuff I don't care about (invoicing, attracting clients, payroll), but that doesn't mean I'm shut out from those things.</li>
      <li>Open space with great light.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Eric Oestrich, Developer: I like that I get to go to conferences such as RESTFest and RubyConf.</p>
    <p>Dan Ivovich, Director of Development Operations</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The respect and trust to make technical decisions without management oversight.</li>
      <li>Autonomy to do the work as we see best, and the support of management to convey to the client we are doing the best work possible as a result.</li>
      <li>Culture that always supports the best way being the only way things should be done.</li>
      <li>Flexibility in working hours to accommodate life, but dedication from everyone to try and work the same hours to increase collaboration and support of each other's work.</li>
      <li>We use the best tools we can, and the best process we can, so that developers are happy and enjoy doing the best work they can do</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yair Flicker, President: everyone here is really smart and independent.  There's no need to micromanage.  There is no stress. ayI'm always learning new things.</p>
