  description: "Today we are joined by the Vice President of Engineering at Corvus
    Insurance, Erik Person! Erik continues our journey into the magic of the BEAM,
    our season-long theme for the Elixir Wizards Podcast, and we get to hear all about
    Erik's path in programming, his relationship with Elixir, and his utilization
    of the BEAM. Growing up in a family involved in computer science, and an early
    affinity for technology made the choice of what to study at college a straightforward
    one for Erik. He tells us about his life during and after those school years,
    touching on his first job and the important milestones leading up to his current
    position at Corvus. We talk about his early feelings for Elixir and why it appealed
    to him almost immediately before discussing different languages on the BEAM and
    his love of types! Our guest also shares some of the bigger challenges he has
    encountered working in Elixir and touches on the issue of scaling effectively.
    In this episode, we also air a mini-feature with SmartLogic's very own Stephanie
    Vizzi, talking about her work at the company, relationship with Elixir, and more!
    So for all this, plus a lot in between, be sure to tune in!\nKey Points From This
    Episode:\nErik's family ties to computer science and his path leading into programming.
    \nThe first job that Erik landed in programming and his current role at Corvus
    Insurance.\nThe BEAM at Corvus and the general architecture of the company's technology.
    \nErik's first encounters and learnings with Elixir and the questions it answered
    for him immediately.\nThe learning curve for languages on The BEAM; Erik's own
    journey to understanding.\nErik's preference for types and his wish for their
    inclusion on Elixir!\nLisp on The BEAM; Erik unpacks his perspectives and the
    blog post he wrote on the subject. \nGetting to grips with abstract forms and
    how these terms operate in Erlang and Elixir. \nThe challenges that Erik experienced
    parsing and manipulating the code in Elixir.  \nErik weighs in on BEAM magic;
    appreciating the magic that is possible with Elixir and Elm. \nPerspectives on
    scaling on Elm and Elixir as an application grows rapidly.\nHow Erik and his team
    typically use contexts and service-oriented architecture.\nChallenges with compile
    times during the process of scaling of the application.\nExcitement about the
    progressive steps in the data science component of Corvus. \nHow Erik applied
    his skills to his passion for playing blackjack by creating a card-counting application.

  description: "Welcome to a brand-spanking-new season of Elixir Wizards! This time
    around we will be focussing on the magic of the BEAM, so get ready for an exciting
    journey into new territories filled with mystery and power! To kick things off
    in this inaugural episode we are joined by a true legend in the space of Erlang,
    Elixir, and the BEAM. Robert Virding is one of the three founding members of Erlang,
    and his unrivaled intimacy with the language and its related subjects is truly
    inspiring and informative. We feel like we could fill many more episodes just
    hearing Robert unpack the history he has been involved in, but we do manage to
    cover a lot in this show, touching on Robert's career arcs, the other founders
    of Erlang, the connection to Ericsson and the bridge to Elixir, as well as much
    more. Robert also shares some insight into the BEAM and the idea of a virtual
    machine, broaching these sometimes misunderstood concepts with simplicity and
    clarity. We talk about magic, hurdles, best practices, and the future of community,
    with Robert sharing his experiences working on Erlog, LFE, and much more. Make
    sure to join us for this episode and stay tuned for the rest of another great
    season!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nRobert's description of the Erlang Rationale
    document and why it was important to create it. \nBackground information on the
    founding three members of Erlang and how they came together. \nTraining and early
    career as a computer scientist; Robert's background before Ericsson. \nThe roots
    of the Erlang name, and how Robert first came across and connected with it. \nThe
    simplest definition of the BEAM, Bogdan’s Erlang Abstract Machine! \nUnpacking
    the application of a virtual machine and the connection between Erlang and BEAM.\nInformation
    on Core Erlang and how it works within the compiler.\nLFE or Lisp-Flavored Erlang
    and the decisions that were made to keep it straightforward. \nHurdles to learning
    Erlang and Robert's thoughts on getting over these. \nWeighing the usefulness
    of 'magic' and the caution with which Robert approaches it. \nBest practices for
    Erlang and Elixir according to Robert; the biggest shifts necessary for success.\nRobert's
    first feelings about the arrival of Elixir and the questions it raised for him.
    \nThe motivation behind Robert's work on Erlog! \nReflections on the Erlang movies
    that Ericsson produced and their evolution over time! \nThe future of Erlang,
    its community, and the need for continued and increased collaboration. \nWhy Robert

  description: "Season 5 ends with a bang as we welcome back Sean Lewis, Anna Neyzber,
    and René Föhring onto the show to share their journey on getting their companies
    and teams to adopt Elixir. We open our conversation with each guest sharing their
    first experiences with Elixir. After chatting about the changes that they’ve seen
    in the Elixir ecosystem, we explore Elixir’s benefits and how they’ve persuaded
    companies to make the Elixir leap. From zero downtime deployment to arguing for
    Elixir’s ability to solve immediate problems, we touch on the most convincing
    reasons for stakeholders to adopt Elixir. Following this, we unpack common Elixir
    criticisms before looking at the importance of hiring developers for their aptitude
    as well as for their skill set. Later, we discuss what we most appreciate about
    Elixir, with each guest sharing a story from producing an Elixir app. We round
    off an insightful episode by talking about Elixir accessibility and the top ways
    to train entry-level programmers. Join us as we wrap up this season for a last
    deep-dive on adopting Elixir. \nKey Points From This Episode:\nWe introduce today’s
    panel, featuring Sean Lewis, Anna Neyzberg, and René Föhring.\nHear how each guest
    discovered Elixir and what they’ve seen change in the ecosystem.\nExploring our
    guests' first Elixir projects. \nThe intersections between Elixir and cryptocurrency.\nHow
    to persuade company stakeholders to adopt Elixir. \nWhy choosing a language for
    scalability often isn’t as important as its immediate benefits.\nUnpacking common
    criticisms of Elixir adoption.\nHow a culture of learning can push your company
    in the right direction.\nAnecdotes on getting companies to adopt Elixir.\nWe touch
    on the benefits of using Elixir. \nEach guest reflects on their experiences producing
    and maintaining Elixir apps. \nHow our guests are currently using Elixir.\nUsing
    Credo to train new Elixir developers. \nAdvice on making Elixir accessible to

  description: "The fields of data science and machine learning are moving ever faster.
    Jenn Gamble has her finger on the pulse and has become an industry expert with
    a wealth of experience to her name. As today’s guest, she dives into these rich
    and often complex topics, and she helps us boil them down into palatable nuggets
    of knowledge. We start off by asking Jenn about her current role at Very, and
    she tells us about the nature of her team and the things they’re able to achieve.
    She touches on what the language markups look like for a data science team, before
    moving onto her experiences in machine learning and data science. Delving deeper,
    Jenn tells us why it is not a necessity to have a master’s in data science, and
    why you can be well enough equipped in other senses to become proficient in the
    area. Later on, she reveals the differences between Elixir models and data science
    models. Following these detailed explanations, she furnishes listener’s minds
    with informative comments on relating the foundations of machine learning to IoT,
    using priori knowledge to add nuance to your machine learning, and how she envisions
    the future of data science. Join us today and be sure to get all this, and much

  description: "As users increasingly demand interactivity from their web experiences,
    Phoenix LiveView is becoming the dominant way of writing interactive Elixir applications
    without a loss to reliability. Today we welcome back an old friend of the show
    and GitHub engineer Sophie DeBenedetto to talk about her upcoming book, Programming
    Phoenix LiveView. We open our conversation with Sophie by hearing about her work
    at GitHub, as well as what we can expect from the Code BEAM V conference. As she
    doesn’t always get to use Elixir at her job, Sophie then discusses how coders
    can sharpen their Elixir skills when not at work. After exploring how companies
    can begin adopting Elixir through event-driven design, we dive into Sophie’s book.
    She unpacks the value of LiveView when building efficient web applications before
    touching on how her book can best help people to learn LiveView. We ask Sophie
    how intertwined the future of Elixir is to the success of LiveView and how this
    might impact Phoenix. Her answers highlight LiveView’s role in pushing Elixir
    adoption while also making Elixir easier to learn. We wrap up our discussion by
    chatting about the challenges of technical writing and Sophie’s experience working
    with the wonderful Pragmatic Programmers publishing house. Tune in to hear more
    insights into programming LiveView; if you believe the hype, it’s “one of the
    most important new frameworks of our generation.” \nKey Points From This Episode:\nWe
    catch up with guest Sophie DeBenedetto and hear about the Code BEAM V conference.\nSophie
    shares her feelings on coding in Go.\nHow Sophie engages with Elixir when it’s
    not a key part of her day job.\nWhat Flatiron School did to work towards Elixir

    summary: "\n        <p>As users increasingly demand interactivity from their web
      experiences, Phoenix LiveView is becoming the dominant way of writing interactive
      Elixir applications without a loss to reliability. Today we welcome back an
      old friend of the show and GitHub engineer Sophie DeBenedetto to talk about
      her upcoming book, Programming Phoenix LiveView. We open our conversation with
      Sophie by hearing about her work at GitHub, as well as what we can expect from
      the Code BEAM V conference. As she doesn’t always get to use Elixir at her job,
      Sophie then discusses how coders can sharpen their Elixir skills when not at
      work. After exploring how companies can begin adopting Elixir through event-driven
      design, we dive into Sophie’s book. She unpacks the value of LiveView when building
      efficient web applications before touching on how her book can best help people
      to learn LiveView. We ask Sophie how intertwined the future of Elixir is to
      the success of LiveView and how this might impact Phoenix. Her answers highlight
      LiveView’s role in pushing Elixir adoption while also making Elixir easier to
      learn. We wrap up our discussion by chatting about the challenges of technical
      writing and Sophie’s experience working with the wonderful Pragmatic Programmers
      publishing house. Tune in to hear more insights into programming LiveView; if
      you believe the hype, it’s “one of the most important new frameworks of our
      generation.” </p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We catch

  description: "With the prevalence of at-home learning, teachers have to compete
    for student attention against numerous screen-based activities. Today we speak
    with engineering lead Shaun Robinson and Elixir developer Toran Billups about
    how Legends of Learning helps educators make their classrooms fun, engaging, and
    productive through their curriculum-based games. After chatting about Legends’
    mission to empower teachers, we talk with Toran about how he landed a job there.
    He then shares his insights into securing Elixir jobs, touching on the importance
    of networking and building a portfolio of Elixir projects. We discuss why Elixir
    became Legends’ language of choice before exploring their process in adopting
    Elixir. Reflecting on their early server structure, Shaun explains their process
    of refactoring from their old code base into an Elixir monolith. Responding to
    a previous episode, where frustrations were shared about coding in LiveView, Toran
    talks about its advantages, despite its issues as a new technology. Later, Shaun
    and Toran dive into what you can do to help your company adopt Elixir. We wrap
    up another incredible conversation by asking our guests about their favorite Legend
    of Learning games. Tune in to hear more about Legend of Learning’s Elixir journey
    and how they’re using it to create dynamic learning environments. \nKey Points
    From This Episode:\nExploring the mission and work of the Legends of Learning
    startup.\nShaun and Toran share details about their backgrounds.  \nWhy building
    a van home is so similar to building software.  \nHear about Toran’s podcast on
    the human side of programming.\nShaun talks about the time when he sold his Twitter
    and GitHub handle.\nWhat Toran did to land his first Elixir job.\nWhy Legends

  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>With the prevalence of at-home learning, teachers
    have to compete for student attention against numerous screen-based activities.
    Today we speak with engineering lead Shaun Robinson and Elixir developer Toran
    Billups about how Legends of Learning helps educators make their classrooms fun,
    engaging, and productive through their curriculum-based games. After chatting
    about Legends’ mission to empower teachers, we talk with Toran about how he landed
    a job there. He then shares his insights into securing Elixir jobs, touching on
    the importance of networking and building a portfolio of Elixir projects. We discuss
    why Elixir became Legends’ language of choice before exploring their process in
    adopting Elixir. Reflecting on their early server structure, Shaun explains their
    process of refactoring from their old code base into an Elixir monolith. Responding
    to a previous episode, where frustrations were shared about coding in LiveView,
    Toran talks about its advantages, despite its issues as a new technology. Later,

    of end-to-end food delivery and ghost kitchens. Today we speak with ClusterTruck
    Product VP Brian Howenstein to find out more about his journey in programming,
    ClusterTruck as an end-to-end food service, and how Elixir became mission-critical
    to the success of the business. \nWe kick things off by hearing more on Brian’s
    childhood and how he became interested in programming. We then hear about his
    internship at Apple where he was part of the Core OS networking team. Brian touches
    on brushing shoulders with Steve Jobs, Jony Ivy, and Tim Cook, and shares how
    these personalities changed his view of the tech industry. Later in the show,
    we turn our attention to current times. Brian expands on his role at ClusterTruck
    and shares details on how Elixir has played a vital role in the company’s success.
    We hear his take on vertical integration, why they’d never consider third-party
    delivery companies, and much more. We then briefly digress to Brian’s hobby: the
    Scottish Games, before returning to ClusterTruck to find out what his favorite
    menu items are and what the future holds for food delivery and ghost kitchens.

    rewriting the method of end-to-end food delivery and ghost kitchens. Today we
    speak with ClusterTruck Product VP Brian Howenstein to find out more about his
    journey in programming, ClusterTruck as an end-to-end food service, and how Elixir
    became mission-critical to the success of the business. </p>\n\n<p>We kick things
    off by hearing more on Brian’s childhood and how he became interested in programming.
    We then hear about his internship at Apple where he was part of the Core OS networking
    team. Brian touches on brushing shoulders with Steve Jobs, Jony Ivy, and Tim Cook,
    and shares how these personalities changed his view of the tech industry. Later
    in the show, we turn our attention to current times. Brian expands on his role
    at ClusterTruck and shares details on how Elixir has played a vital role in the
    company’s success. We hear his take on vertical integration, why they’d never
    consider third-party delivery companies, and much more. We then briefly digress
    to Brian’s hobby: the Scottish Games, before returning to ClusterTruck to find
    out what his favorite menu items are and what the future holds for food delivery
    and ghost kitchens. </p>\n\n<p>Be sure to stay tuned to enjoy our mini-feature
    where we speak with Michelle Morry, a software engineer at FuturePet. For all
    things Elixir, be sure to join us today! </p>\n\n<p>Bonus: If you’re in Indianapolis,

    “ELIXIRWIZARDS” at checkout for a one-time 25% discount on your ClusterTruck order.

  description: "Despite its welcoming character, the Elixir community struggles with
    diversity; as the 2020 ElixirConf community survey shows, only 2% of Elixirists
    are women. Today we speak with Blinker software engineer Alexandra Chakeres about
    her experience of the community, as well as what we can do to make it more inclusive.
    We open by exploring Alexandra’s background and coding career. After expressing
    her enthusiasm for the Turing School, we talk about Alexandra’s learn-by-doing
    approach to picking up Elixir. She shares how she landed her first Elixir job
    before we chat about her current role at Blinker. We discuss why the small size
    of the community means that Alexandra doesn’t recommend Elixir to coding beginners.
    We then dive into the topic of Elixir diversity, touching on factors that limit
    inclusivity, including how few Elixir positions are available for juniors. Alexandra
    unpacks solutions, like how organizations can shift their hiring pipeline and
    the need to approach diversity organizations with openings. Later, listeners will
    enjoy our mini-feature segment where we interview Instinct Science engineer Bill
    Peregoy about how their team uses Elixir. Tune in for more on what we can do to
    create a more diverse community. \nKey Points From This Episode:\nHear how co-host
    Sundi Myint first met Alexandra.\nAlexandra shares details about her coding background.\nWhy
    Alexandra feels so passionately about Turing Boot Camp.\nDetails about Alexandra’s
    first Elixir job.\nWhat Alexandra’s current team builds in Elixir and her experience
    using umbrella apps.\nComparing Ruby with Elixir and insights into what Elixir
    is missing. \nWhy Alexandra doesn’t recommend that junior engineers first learn
    Elixir.\nHow restricted Elixir hirings lead to a lack of diversity in the community.
    \nExploring ways to make the Elixir community more diverse. \nWhat Alexandra most
    enjoys about coding in Elixir.\nAlexandra’s top advice for minorities in the Elixir
    community.\nWhy it’s up to all of us to create a more inclusive community.\nWe
    talk to Bill Peregoy about how the team at Instinct Science uses Elixir.\nBill’s
    challenges and benefits to writing in Elixir.\nHow Bill would help new hires learn
    Elixir.\nLinks Mentioned in Today’s Episode:\nSmartLogic — https://smartlogic.io/\nElixir

    Elixir is a dynamic, functional language that packs a punch. Built on the strengths of its predecessors like Ruby and Erlang, it sits comfortably in a space where performance and scalability are at a premium. Today we speak with Brian Cardarella, owner and former member of DockYard, to find out more about Elixir and why he feels it serves companies and employees so well. We open the show by studying Elixir’s DNA, learning more about Ruby on Rails and what made it so attractive as an offering during its heyday. Brian then shifts scope and talks about why Ember has steadily failed, and touches on a lack of efficiency and poor marketing strategies as the obvious catalysts for its demise. As our conversation develops, Brian dives deeper into Elixir, sharing nuggets of wisdom and entertaining anecdotes along the way. Listeners will hear why Elixir performs so strongly and how he believes companies should go about adopting the language. Brian expands on the topic and shares which types of clients should be open to Elixir and the methods you can use to convert them. As we near the end of the episode, we hear from Brian about Lumen’s characteristics and at what point developers will be able to write an app without JavaScript in Elixir. To find out more, be sure to join us today!
    Key Points From This Episode:
    Introducing today’s guest, DockYard’s Brian Cardarella.
    Why Brian doesn’t think Ember is relevant as a topic of conversation.
    What made Ruby on Rails the go-to language for a new generation of developers.

  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>Elixir is a dynamic, functional language that packs
    a punch. Built on the strengths of its predecessors like Ruby and Erlang, it sits
    comfortably in a space where performance and scalability are at a premium. Today
    we speak with Brian Cardarella, owner and former member of DockYard, to find out
    more about Elixir and why he feels it serves companies and employees so well.
    We open the show by studying Elixir’s DNA, learning more about Ruby on Rails and
    what made it so attractive as an offering during its heyday. Brian then shifts
    scope and talks about why Ember has steadily failed, and touches on a lack of
    efficiency and poor marketing strategies as the obvious catalysts for its demise.
    As our conversation develops, Brian dives deeper into Elixir, sharing nuggets
    of wisdom and entertaining anecdotes along the way. Listeners will hear why Elixir
    performs so strongly and how he believes companies should go about adopting the
    language. Brian expands on the topic and shares which types of clients should
    be open to Elixir and the methods you can use to convert them. As we near the
    end of the episode, we hear from Brian about Lumen’s characteristics and at what
    point developers will be able to write an app without JavaScript in Elixir. To
    find out more, be sure to join us today!</p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Introducing
    today’s guest, DockYard’s Brian Cardarella.</li>\n<li>Why Brian doesn’t think
    Ember is relevant as a topic of conversation.</li>\n<li>What made Ruby on Rails
    the go-to language for a new generation of developers.</li>\n<li>The reasons for
    Ember’s failing, according to Brian.</li>\n<li>Brian’s transition from Ruby on
    Rails to Elixir.</li>\n<li>The challenges that come with organizing software conferences.</li>\n<li>Areas
    where Elixir is performing and lagging.</li>\n<li>Why Brian prefers supporting
    companies that do not have huge corporate backing.</li>\n<li>Hear why Brian wanted
    to introduce Elixir at DockYard.</li>\n<li>How Brian believes companies should
    go about adopting Elixir.</li>\n<li>The challenges that come with junior and senior
    developers.</li>\n<li>Brain talks about the intricacies of optional type systems
    and real type systems.</li>\n<li>How Elixir adoption should be performed.</li>\n<li>Brian
    describes Lumen’s characteristics.</li>\n<li>Find out at what point you will be

    In this episode we continue our conversation about adopting Elixir, this time with Matt Nowack and Jake Heinz from Discord, hearing them get into the features of Elixir that make it a great fit for building a real-time chat infrastructure system! We also invite Arthi Radhakrishnan from community.com for our mini-interview in the last chunk of the episode. Our chat begins with Jake and Matt telling Elixir developers exactly why they should not use Mnesia. They subsequently dive into their journeys in programming and the process of learning Elixir after joining Discord. They share a few aha-moments as well as challenging projects that asked them to get their heads around some of the more powerful features of Elixir, highlighting a way they used immutability for a project that asked them to efficiently calculate deltas for large member list updates. From there we get into the culture around onboarding new devs at Discord, the company’s popular open-source Elixir contributions, and some brags about the high performance of features of Discord built in Elixir. Wrapping up with Jake and Matt, we hear their suggestions for teams and devs hoping to adopt Elixir, where they strongly advise on learning OTP as well as Elixir’s standard library. After that, it’s time for our chat with Arthi, where we hear about her programming journey, how Elixir is being put to use at Community.com, how the company supports new devs learning Elixir, and more!
    Key Points From This Episode:
    Our guests’ thoughts on why Elixir developers shouldn’t use the database driver Mnesia.
    How Jake and Matt got into programming and learned Elixir after joining Discord.
    The history of the use of Elixir at Discord and some of the projects Jake helped build since.

    Welcome back to the Elixir Wizards podcast! In this episode, we will be continuing our conversation on the theme of adopting elixir, and our great guest for today is Jason Axelson! Jason is a back-end developer for a mixed reality studio called Animal Repair Shop and has also made some significant contributions to the Elixir Language Server project. We kick off our conversation with Jason hearing about his programming journey and then dive into the event chat service app he helped build using Elixir while he was working at Hobnob. From there, we talk about some of his aha moments while learning Elixir and some of his favorite features about the language which he is putting to use building out the back end for Animal Repair Shop. Next, we turn our attention to Elixir Language Server and Jason weighs in on the IDE type features it offers, why he got started as a collaborator on the project, and some of their challenges in the field of shared governance. Wrapping up for today, Jason makes a few suggestions for how devs who love Elixir can convince their teams to adopt it as a more mainstream option. Tune in for a great chat on the topic of adopting Elixir!

    can tell you that it is in desperate need of innovation — shockingly many of their
    cobwebbed systems were built in the 70s. Today we speak with Duffel CEO Steve
    Domin, who is building tech that can finally align travel with the expectations
    of modern consumers. We open by exploring Steve’s journey into coding before diving
    into how Duffel is innovating travel. After touching on how the pandemic has impacted
    Duffel’s roll-out, Steve shares horror stories about the outdated tech and API
    systems that airlines use. We discuss Duffel’s service offerings and why Elixir
    is uniquely suited to solve the problems that Steve’s company is addressing. Steve
    then talks about the types of engineers that Duffel hires, his client base, and
    where his company is heading. Near the end of the episode, we ask Steve for his
    advice on selling your company on Elixir and we chat about the status of the London
    Elixir Meetup. Tune in for more insights on how Steve is using Elixir to make

  description: "Today we sit down with Erlanger Viktória Fördős, who talks with us
    about Erlang and how it is used at Cisco. We open the show by finding out about
    Viki’s background in coding and her unorthodox entry into the field. After hearing
    about her experiences in her school choir and her transition into the informatics
    faculty, Viki talks to us about her first experiences in coding and the thrills
    she found in it. She then expands on the topic, revealing how she approached people
    to build their websites using her newfound skills in HTML and PHP. A flash-forward
    later, and Viki shares details about her role as an NSO Core Engineer for Cisco.
    After hearing how NSO serves as a network operating system, device automation
    platform, and orchestration engine, Viki explains why NSO is so special. She touches
    on fast map-based service and some of the ways she and her team implement network-wide
    transactions using — you guessed it — Erlang. Viki then explains Erlang, how you
    should approach it if you’re a newbie, and what to expect from its biggest challenges.
    She elaborates on tail-recursive functions and high-level vulnerabilities concerned
    with SSL crypto libraries, system integrity, and atom tables. Toward the end of
    the show, we ask Viki to tell us about her Code BEAM presentation and about her
    thoughts on why academia and industry should collaborate on a more regular basis.

  description: "Today’s guest is Simon Glenn-Gregg, News Engineer at The Washington
    Post. He joins us to talk about using Elixir to build a prototype for a platform
    the news house recently implemented to visualize the results of the November 2020
    elections in real-time. \nWhile the job title of ‘News Engineer’ makes it seem
    like Simon invents news, this is not the case. He is focused on software related
    to publishing at The Washington Post, and in particular, has been working on building
    their election visualization platform for the past two years. Before the final
    iteration of the platform was built, the software engineering team at The Washington
    Post were given a period to test different technologies as an experiment to find
    the best fit, and Simon decided to try his hand at Elixir and Phoenix. He talks
    about what led him to this choice, and his experiences building out his prototype
    which he demonstrated on a dataset generated by the North Carolina 3rd Congressional
    District house race in September. Simon tells us about how the pitch went, what
    the team at The Washington Post was especially impressed by, and what led to the
    choice to use Node in the end. \nSimon talks about the culture of openness to
    new technologies at The Washington Post as well as some of the limitations to
    their adoption. We also hear about how the final version of the visualization
    platform held up during the elections proper, and Simon’s plans to include Elixir
    in future stacks due to its amazing abilities as far as concurrency and memory.
    Tune in today! \nKey Points From This Episode:\nWhat kinds of projects Simon works
    on at The Washington Post as a ‘news engineer’.\nThe live updating election visualizer
    that Simon was working on at The Washington Post.\nWhat went into building the
    infrastructure for this platform and how Elixir was chosen as a candidate.\n A
    blog post about Elixir’s memory management; abilities Elixir has regarding concurrency.\nThe
    first steps Simon took toward learning Elixir and Phoenix by building simple projects.\nSimon’s
    process of integrating his Elixir app into the current stack and people at The
    Washington Post.\nTesting the app on the 3rd Congressional District house race
    in North Carolina, and pitching to the team.\nWhy it is hard to implement projects
    in new languages at The Washington Post.\nHow the voting process went after the
    pitch and which project won.\nWhat the audience at the pitch loved about Elixir,
    and what the stumbling blocks were.\nThe nature of working at a deadline-driven
    place like The Washington Post when it comes to adopting new technologies.\nSources
    The Washington Post used to get their election data.\nWhat technologies and methods
    the team used to handle the size of data some election moments generated.\nWhich
    parts about the election visualizer that ended up being built using Node would
    have been easier to do in Elixir.\nThe other side of the coin – what made writing
    the app in Python and JavaScript easier.\nWhat future projects Elixir might be
    better suited to at The Washington Post.\nSimon’s background, education, and how
    he learned programming in previous jobs\nWhy Simon stuck programming out and decided
    it was the right path for him.\nThe need for software engineers at The Washington
    Post and why they are recruiting so often.\nA deep dive into the tech stack at
    The Washington Post and how they render their pages and maps.\nHow Simon feels
    having reached the end of a successful project that millions of people engaged
    with.\nFuture projects at The Washington Post and Simon’s hopes to incorporate
    more Elixir.\nA funny story about having to manually update the votes from rural
    New Hampshire into the app.\nLinks Mentioned in Today’s Episode:\nSmartLogic —

    summary: "\n        <p>Today’s guest is Simon Glenn-Gregg, News Engineer at The
      Washington Post. He joins us to talk about using Elixir to build a prototype
      for a platform the news house recently implemented to visualize the results
      of the November 2020 elections in real-time. </p>\n\n<p>While the job title
      of ‘News Engineer’ makes it seem like Simon invents news, this is not the case.
      He is focused on software related to publishing at The Washington Post, and
      in particular, has been working on building their election visualization platform
      for the past two years. Before the final iteration of the platform was built,
      the software engineering team at The Washington Post were given a period to
      test different technologies as an experiment to find the best fit, and Simon
      decided to try his hand at Elixir and Phoenix. He talks about what led him to
      this choice, and his experiences building out his prototype which he demonstrated
      on a dataset generated by the North Carolina 3rd Congressional District house
      race in September. Simon tells us about how the pitch went, what the team at
      The Washington Post was especially impressed by, and what led to the choice
      to use Node in the end. </p>\n\n<p>Simon talks about the culture of openness
      to new technologies at The Washington Post as well as some of the limitations
      to their adoption. We also hear about how the final version of the visualization
      platform held up during the elections proper, and Simon’s plans to include Elixir
      in future stacks due to its amazing abilities as far as concurrency and memory.
      Tune in today! </p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What
      kinds of projects Simon works on at The Washington Post as a ‘news engineer’.</li>\n<li>The
      live updating election visualizer that Simon was working on at The Washington
      Post.</li>\n<li>What went into building the infrastructure for this platform
      and how Elixir was chosen as a candidate.</li>\n<li> A blog post about Elixir’s
      memory management; abilities Elixir has regarding concurrency.</li>\n<li>The
      first steps Simon took toward learning Elixir and Phoenix by building simple
      projects.</li>\n<li>Simon’s process of integrating his Elixir app into the current
      stack and people at The Washington Post.</li>\n<li>Testing the app on the 3rd
      Congressional District house race in North Carolina, and pitching to the team.</li>\n<li>Why
      it is hard to implement projects in new languages at The Washington Post.</li>\n<li>How
      the voting process went after the pitch and which project won.</li>\n<li>What
      the audience at the pitch loved about Elixir, and what the stumbling blocks
      were.</li>\n<li>The nature of working at a deadline-driven place like The Washington
      Post when it comes to adopting new technologies.</li>\n<li>Sources The Washington
      Post used to get their election data.</li>\n<li>What technologies and methods
      the team used to handle the size of data some election moments generated.</li>\n<li>Which
      parts about the election visualizer that ended up being built using Node would
      have been easier to do in Elixir.</li>\n<li>The other side of the coin – what
      made writing the app in Python and JavaScript easier.</li>\n<li>What future
      projects Elixir might be better suited to at The Washington Post.</li>\n<li>Simon’s
      background, education, and how he learned programming in previous jobs</li>\n<li>Why
      Simon stuck programming out and decided it was the right path for him.</li>\n<li>The
      need for software engineers at The Washington Post and why they are recruiting
      so often.</li>\n<li>A deep dive into the tech stack at The Washington Post and

      the end of a successful project that millions of people engaged with.</li>\n<li>Future

  description: "The culture of your programming community directly impacts your professional
    success. As Thunderbolt Labs Founder Randall Thomas explains in this episode,
    a community that practices openness and which warmly welcomes its newer members
    leads to greater career happiness. \nWe open our chat with Randall by exploring
    his start in coding and how he discovered Elixir. He shares some of the teething
    problems that he had moving from Ruby to Elixir before we touch on how learning
    other languages expands your ability to both appreciate and code in languages
    that you’re already fluent in. Following this, Randall explodes the myth of the
    genius polyglot programmer by sharing his take on why all coders are polyglots.
    As the Thunderbolt CEO, we ask Randall how his company adopted Elixir. He provides
    listeners with insights into how they introduced Elixir into their practice without
    affecting existing projects. \nAfter highlighting the efficiency of Elixir and
    how community affects the feel of a language, we compare the culture and challenges
    of Ruby, JavaScript, and Elixir. Near the end of the episode, Randall reflects
    on why experts make for poor teachers. For Randall, Elixir gives his company a
    competitive advantage. Tune in to hear Randall’s perspective on why community
    matters and for his top advice on teaching your team Elixir. \nKey Points From
    This Episode:\nIntroducing Thunderbolt Labs Founder and CEO, Randall Thomas.\nRandall
    shares how he discovered coding and engineering. \nHear how Randall first heard
    about Elixir and how he picked up the language.\nExploring common challenges moving
    from Ruby to Elixir. \nHow learning new languages can deepen your understanding
    of languages that you already know.\nWhy there’s no such thing as the ‘genius
    polyglot programmer.’ \nDetails on why Randall’s company began gravitating towards
    Elixir.\nHow communities affect the ‘feel’ of a language.\nWhy no one actually
    writes in JavaScript anymore. \nRandall gives his take on why Elixir is a god-send
    for certain programmers. \nInsights into how Randall integrated Elixir into his
    company.\nThe challenge of learning Elixir versus the ease of learning JavaScript.\nHow
    Randall sold his clients on Elixir and the benefits of having clients that trust
    you.\nRandall’s top tips on helping your developers learn Elixir.\nWhy Elixir
    gives Randall’s a strategic advantage.\nThe importance of having non-experts explain
    things to you. \nHow your coding community can impact your happiness and career

  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>The culture of your programming community directly
    impacts your professional success. As Thunderbolt Labs Founder Randall Thomas
    explains in this episode, a community that practices openness and which warmly
    welcomes its newer members leads to greater career happiness. </p>\n\n<p>We open
    our chat with Randall by exploring his start in coding and how he discovered Elixir.
    He shares some of the teething problems that he had moving from Ruby to Elixir
    before we touch on how learning other languages expands your ability to both appreciate
    and code in languages that you’re already fluent in. Following this, Randall explodes
    the myth of the genius polyglot programmer by sharing his take on why all coders
    are polyglots. As the Thunderbolt CEO, we ask Randall how his company adopted
    Elixir. He provides listeners with insights into how they introduced Elixir into
    their practice without affecting existing projects. </p>\n\n<p>After highlighting
    the efficiency of Elixir and how community affects the feel of a language, we
    compare the culture and challenges of Ruby, JavaScript, and Elixir. Near the end
    of the episode, Randall reflects on why experts make for poor teachers. For Randall,
    Elixir gives his company a competitive advantage. Tune in to hear Randall’s perspective
    on why community matters and for his top advice on teaching your team Elixir.

  description: "To close off this season and conclude our deep dive into system and
    application architecture, today’s episode is a special panel discussion on a topic
    that has provoked a mix of answers that range from the controversial to the philosophical
    — “What does domain-driven design mean to you?” For the final word on this subject,
    we welcome back software developers Chris Keathley, Japa Swadia, Mark Windholtz,
    and Miki Rezentes. Our first hot take comes from Miki, who shares her thoughts
    about how domain-driven design developed because the tech industry undervalues
    communication. Following this, Mark and Japa discuss how domain-driven design
    gives developers a context for what they create while informing how you code using
    Elixir. We then touch on whether domain-driven design makes it easier or more
    difficult to change your code and how communication is valued within a business
    context. We explore key domain-driven design concepts, including the role of bounded
    contexts, and how this design ethos can help you appeal to stakeholders such as
    product managers. After Miki highlights the reasons why communication should be
    seen as a vital tech skill, each guest provides their final thoughts on domain-driven
    design. Tune in for this season’s insightful finale and find out which of today’s
    guests is the winner of “Whose Design Is It Anyway?”\nKey Points From This Episode:\nIntroducing

  description: "Even with the most programming experience in the world, coding still
    involves a lot of trial and error. People getting started in the industry should
    not become bogged down by failure. Because in the end, it’s a feature and not
    a bug. That’s one of Zillion developer Anna Sherman’s key messages this episode.
    We open our discussion with Anna by talking about living in Chattanooga, AKA,
    Gig City. She talks about why the tech scene there is exploding before diving
    into her journey into programming. Having created her own personal coding boot
    camp, she opens up about what she did to land her first software job within only

  description: "There is no difference between architecture and design. It's all engineering
    and creating a distinction between the two is a way for someone to get paid more
    and have a different title. That hot take comes from Devon Estes, today’s guest,
    who provides a novel way of seeing design and architecture. We open the episode
    by diving straight into the topic of design, with Devon exploring how good design
    might be less important than developing the right toolset. We then talk about
    how language servers can help you effortlessly define functions, meaning that
    in some cases, it doesn’t matter where you put your code — even if it’s all in
    one file. After touching on game-changing innovations in the world of design,
    such as GTP-3, Devon shares how our design options are limited by our editors.
    Considering the impact of human error on software, we discuss the value of convention
    and rulesets. As Elixir apps or apps that use Phoenix are open-ended, Devon talks
    about his middle-ground solution to help teams overcome this challenge. Near the
    end of the episode, Devon chats about why design and architecture, as elements
    of engineering, are different levels of abstraction and not separate entities.
    Following this, he highlights how domain-driven design can be used to avoid confusion
    and bugs by ensuring that people across departments all use the same language.
    Tune in to hear more of Devon’s unique and well-pondered insights. \nKey Points
    From This Episode:\nDevon’s take on design; “Where things go doesn’t matter if
    you have a language server.” \nDefining what a language server is and its incredible
    usefulness. \nHow ‘go to definition’ functions could render much of design as
    unnecessary. \nGame-changing innovations that will change the world of design.\nFunctional
    versus object-orientated languages and the challenge of finding files.\nWhy Devon
    uses Vim and what makes it attractive to other programmers.\nHow Elixir apps can
    be a challenge due to their open-ended nature.\nCreating primary and secondary
    contexts to give Phoenix more structure. \nThe human factor; why people are often

  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>There is no difference between architecture and design.
    It&#39;s all engineering and creating a distinction between the two is a way for
    someone to get paid more and have a different title. That hot take comes from
    Devon Estes, today’s guest, who provides a novel way of seeing design and architecture.
    We open the episode by diving straight into the topic of design, with Devon exploring
    how good design might be less important than developing the right toolset. We
    then talk about how language servers can help you effortlessly define functions,
    meaning that in some cases, it doesn’t matter where you put your code — even if
    it’s all in one file. After touching on game-changing innovations in the world
    of design, such as GTP-3, Devon shares how our design options are limited by our
    editors. Considering the impact of human error on software, we discuss the value
    of convention and rulesets. As Elixir apps or apps that use Phoenix are open-ended,
    Devon talks about his middle-ground solution to help teams overcome this challenge.
    Near the end of the episode, Devon chats about why design and architecture, as
    elements of engineering, are different levels of abstraction and not separate
    entities. Following this, he highlights how domain-driven design can be used to
    avoid confusion and bugs by ensuring that people across departments all use the
    same language. Tune in to hear more of Devon’s unique and well-pondered insights.
    </p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Devon’s take on design;
    “Where things go doesn’t matter if you have a language server.” </li>\n<li>Defining
    what a language server is and its incredible usefulness. </li>\n<li>How ‘go to
    definition’ functions could render much of design as unnecessary. </li>\n<li>Game-changing
    innovations that will change the world of design.</li>\n<li>Functional versus
    object-orientated languages and the challenge of finding files.</li>\n<li>Why
    Devon uses Vim and what makes it attractive to other programmers.</li>\n<li>How
    Elixir apps can be a challenge due to their open-ended nature.</li>\n<li>Creating
    primary and secondary contexts to give Phoenix more structure. </li>\n<li>The
    human factor; why people are often the cause of many coding issues.</li>\n<li>Hear
    how Devon has been structuring his Absinthe projects.</li>\n<li>Devon shares details
    about his Absinthe testing library, Assertions.</li>\n<li>Devon’s hot take that
    there is no difference between architecture and design.</li>\n<li>The importance
    of domain-driven design in avoiding confusion and bugs.</li>\n<li>Why engineers
    need to push to ensure the same language is used across departments. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Links

  description: "Imagine being hired into a rocketship startup using Elixir as its
    primary language. And all this, straight out of college. Today, we speak with
    systems software engineer, Lizzie Paquette who works at Brex, the aforementioned
    rocketship. We start our conversation by talking about how Lizzie got into coding
    relatively late in her life, partly due to an ill-fated run-in with Java. She
    shares details about her role at Brex and how the company has evolved. With a
    love of compilers, Lizzie dives into what beginners can do to get into compiling
    before chatting about her top underrated Elixir resources. Following this topic,
    Lizzie discusses her experience liberally implementing macros at Brex — something
    that ended up being detrimental when onboarding new hires. After sharing how she
    develops herself as a professional and coder, Lizzie talks about her involvement
    in Code 2040, a career accelerator and mentorship program. \nReflecting this season’s
    theme, we ask for Lizzie’s take on what architecture, design, and domain-driven
    design means to her. She then reveals her coding process and emphasizes the value
    of creating thorough design docs to avoid bugs. We explore Brex’s architecture,
    how it makes use of microliths, and applying ‘chaos engineering’ — a monkey-wrench
    approach to testing your system. We touch on umbrella apps and lessons that Lizzie’s
    learned from working with Brex’s architecture. \nAfter closing our discussion
    with Lizzie, we open with another edition Pattern Matching with Todd Resudek and
    special guest Sophie DeBenedetto from GitHub. Todd asks Sophie about her favorite
    movies, music, and what Elixir projects excite her. Tune in to hear Sophie’s insights,
    along with more on microliths and macros from Lizzie Paquette.\nKey Points From
    This Episode:\nLizzie shares how she got into coding and her start in the industry.\nHear
    about Lizzie’s role at Brex, a rocketship startup and key member of the Elixir
    community.\nHow novices should approach learning how to code compilers. \nUnderrated
    Elixir resources that Lizzie makes the most out of.\nThe double-edged sword; why
    macros are an incredible yet dangerous tool.\nHow Lizzie develops herself as a
    professional and a coder. \nBoosting inclusivity in the software industry through
    programs like Code 2040.\nLizzie’s take on what architecture, design, and domain-driven
    design mean.\nThe value of design docs in catching bugs and laying out a clear
    process. \nMicroliths, microservices, and the nitty-gritty of Brex’s architecture.
    \nExploring ‘chaos engineering’; testing your system by purposefully creating
    problems.  \nLizzie’s pain points when either using or not using umbrella apps.
    \nWhat Lizzie would do if she could rewrite Brex’s architecture from scratch.
    \nUsing Brex.result to streamline code and handle common return values. \nFor
    this edition of Pattern Matching, Todd Resudek interviews Sophie DeBenedetto.\nSophie’s
    journey from liberal arts to learning software at a code boot camp.\nTodd asks

    in Code 2040, a career accelerator and mentorship program. </p>\n\n<p>Reflecting
    this season’s theme, we ask for Lizzie’s take on what architecture, design, and
    domain-driven design means to her. She then reveals her coding process and emphasizes
    the value of creating thorough design docs to avoid bugs. We explore Brex’s architecture,
    how it makes use of microliths, and applying ‘chaos engineering’ — a monkey-wrench
    approach to testing your system. We touch on umbrella apps and lessons that Lizzie’s
    learned from working with Brex’s architecture. </p>\n\n<p>After closing our discussion
    with Lizzie, we open with another edition Pattern Matching with Todd Resudek and
    special guest Sophie DeBenedetto from GitHub. Todd asks Sophie about her favorite
    movies, music, and what Elixir projects excite her. Tune in to hear Sophie’s insights,
    along with more on microliths and macros from Lizzie Paquette.</p>\n\n<p>Key Points
    From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lizzie shares how she got into coding and
    her start in the industry.</li>\n<li>Hear about Lizzie’s role at Brex, a rocketship

  description: "Building a sophisticated AI that can evolve to fit our vast and diverse
    needs is a Herculean challenge. Today we speak with senior engineer Eric Steen
    about Automata, his experimental Elixir project that uses neuroevolution and cutting
    edge theory to create a multi-agent behavior tree — or really good AI in the common
    tongue. But before we tap into that rich topic, we talk with Eric about tech burnout,
    his background, and why Elixir is an excellent language for writing modern software.
    He then unpacks AI concepts like the need to develop backpropagation in your system,
    and the value of “neural diversity,” and Markov decision processes. \nAfter Eric
    gives his take on architecture versus design and the place of domain-driven design,
    we discuss Automata. A key breakthrough, Eric shares his enthusiasm for ‘novelty
    search,’ where machines learn from a variety of new behaviors and searches, as
    opposed to completing one task at a time. We touch on Automata’s progress, Eric’s
    long-term approach, and what his project might be used for. Near the end of our
    interview, we chat about CryptoWise, a collaborative analysis platform for cryptocurrency.
    \nTodd Resudek then opens with another edition of Pattern Matching, where he interviews
    Whatsapp engineer Michał Muskała. They talk about Michał’s career, the movies
    and music that he enjoys, and the projects that excite him. Tune in to hear more
    about both Michał and neuroevolution in AI.\nKey Points From This Episode:\nExperiencing
    tech burnout and challenges around algorithms rendering you redundant.\nHear about
    Eric’s programming background and shifts in the industry. \nBackpropagation and
    using Elixir to build a neural evolutionary system.\nHow Markov decision processes
    help systems choose between possible actions. \nEric’s take on architecture versus
    design and the place of domain-driven design.\nExploring Automata — Eric’s ambitious
    multi-agent behavior tree.\nThe importance of neurodiversity when building AIs;
    they need to adapt to many needs. \nNovelty search; why learn through one task
    when you can learn through a variety of tasks at the same time?\nAutomata’s practical
    applications and why Eric sees it as a long-term project.\nEric shares a progress
    report on his work and using design processes like Sprint. \nWhat Eric would like
    people to use Automata for. \nA sense that Elixir is gaining in popularity within
    Silicon Valley.\nEric gives an elevator-pitch for CryptoWise, a collaborative
    analysis platform for cryptocurrency.\nTodd Resudek interviews Michał Muskała
    on another edition of Pattern Matching.\nMichał shares his background and his
    move from Poland to London. \nMovies and music that Michał enjoys, and details
    on projects that excite him.\nDifferences between Erlang and Elixir and why both
    communities would benefit from working together.\nLinks Mentioned in Today’s Episode:\nSmartLogic

  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>Building a sophisticated AI that can evolve to fit
    our vast and diverse needs is a Herculean challenge. Today we speak with senior
    engineer Eric Steen about Automata, his experimental Elixir project that uses
    neuroevolution and cutting edge theory to create a multi-agent behavior tree —
    or really good AI in the common tongue. But before we tap into that rich topic,
    we talk with Eric about tech burnout, his background, and why Elixir is an excellent
    language for writing modern software. He then unpacks AI concepts like the need
    to develop backpropagation in your system, and the value of “neural diversity,”
    and Markov decision processes. </p>\n\n<p>After Eric gives his take on architecture
    versus design and the place of domain-driven design, we discuss Automata. A key
    breakthrough, Eric shares his enthusiasm for ‘novelty search,’ where machines
    learn from a variety of new behaviors and searches, as opposed to completing one
    task at a time. We touch on Automata’s progress, Eric’s long-term approach, and
    what his project might be used for. Near the end of our interview, we chat about
    CryptoWise, a collaborative analysis platform for cryptocurrency. </p>\n\n<p>Todd
    Resudek then opens with another edition of Pattern Matching, where he interviews
    Whatsapp engineer Michał Muskała. They talk about Michał’s career, the movies
    and music that he enjoys, and the projects that excite him. Tune in to hear more
    about both Michał and neuroevolution in AI.</p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Experiencing
    tech burnout and challenges around algorithms rendering you redundant.</li>\n<li>Hear
    about Eric’s programming background and shifts in the industry. </li>\n<li>Backpropagation
    and using Elixir to build a neural evolutionary system.</li>\n<li>How Markov decision
    processes help systems choose between possible actions. </li>\n<li>Eric’s take
    on architecture versus design and the place of domain-driven design.</li>\n<li>Exploring
    Automata — Eric’s ambitious multi-agent behavior tree.</li>\n<li>The importance
    of neurodiversity when building AIs; they need to adapt to many needs. </li>\n<li>Novelty
    search; why learn through one task when you can learn through a variety of tasks
    at the same time?</li>\n<li>Automata’s practical applications and why Eric sees
    it as a long-term project.</li>\n<li>Eric shares a progress report on his work
    and using design processes like Sprint. </li>\n<li>What Eric would like people
    to use Automata for. </li>\n<li>A sense that Elixir is gaining in popularity within
    Silicon Valley.</li>\n<li>Eric gives an elevator-pitch for CryptoWise, a collaborative
    analysis platform for cryptocurrency.</li>\n<li>Todd Resudek interviews Michał
    Muskała on another edition of Pattern Matching.</li>\n<li>Michał shares his background
    and his move from Poland to London. </li>\n<li>Movies and music that Michał enjoys,
    and details on projects that excite him.</li>\n<li>Differences between Erlang
    and Elixir and why both communities would benefit from working together.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Links

  description: "No one cares about clever code. Instead, people want code that works.
    Code that they can read six months down the line. Today we speak with Johnny Winn,
    who avoids writing clever code by following a clear vision — “Make it work, then
    make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast.” \nA Renaissance
    man, Johnny’s career ranged from cheffing to design before he settled into software
    engineering. Reflecting his many interests, we spend the first section of the
    podcast chatting about cooking. Johnny shares his kitchen secrets before seamlessly
    transitioning into the topic of coding. After touching on why clever code is bad
    code, we explore the trend of ‘componentizing,’ when your views are taken over
    by an endless array of components and folders. Like Johanna Larsson, a previous
    guest, Johnny makes a case for umbrella projects and explains why many of us have
    been using them incorrectly this whole time. \nAn enemy of dogma, Johnny emphasizes
    that teams should use what works best for them, and not what conventional wisdom
    suggests. Following this, we dive into imposing patterns on our architecture bases,
    how design patterns serve as communication tools, and why tribal knowledge leads
    to communication issues. Johnny brings his experience to bear and shares how he
    structures projects while limiting component creation. Near the end of the episode,
    Johnny talks about how he learned the cardinal sins of coding before leaving us
    with his final hot take on living a balanced life. So, tune in for a dynamic conversation
    where Johnny is as likely to share his smoked pork recipe as he is to deliver
    key coding insights.\nKey Points From This Episode:\nIntroducing Johnny Winn and
    why he’s been called a ‘Renaissance man.’\nHow to cook the perfect steak or burger
    — don’t share this with anyone.\nHear about what Johnny would cook if he needed
    to impress you.\nA recipe for the perfect smoked pork shoulder brine.\nFood wars;
    we debate what the best meat and sandwiches are.\nThe inter-industry virtue of
    keeping things simple and why clever code is bad code.\nExploring the trend of
    ‘componentizing’ everything to extreme levels. \nThe case for umbrella projects
    and why most people are doing it wrong.\nIgnoring conventional wisdom and favoring
    approaches that best work for a team. \nWinging it versus adding too many components
    and nested file structures.  \nHow design patterns function as a way to communicate.
    \nWhy developing tribal knowledge can lead to communication issues. \nJohnny’s
    mission when coding; “Make it work, make it beautiful, make it fast.”\nThe method

  description: "According to an ancient myth, the world rests on the back of a turtle.
    And what does that turtle stand on? Another turtle. It turns out that it’s turtles
    all the way down. Miki Rezentes, today’s guest, believes that all software rests
    on the back of APIs. Similar to the myth, it’s APIs all the way down. We open
    our conversation by discussing how homeschooling her children did more to prepare
    Miki for a software career than anything else she’s encountered. Miki shares highlights
    from her talk, ‘APIs All the Way Down’. This set up this episode’s key theme,
    that the tech industry is too concerned with how its software interacts to focus
    on how the people in its organizations communicate — their ‘human APIs.’ Following
    this, we ask Miki how she learns people’s APIs and we talk about the benefits
    of observation and mirroring. Tracking her career, we touch on how Miki transitioned
    from a homemaker to a developer before diving into her recent work at the data
    science platform Mode. She provides unique insights into how she views architecture
    and design and why the concept of domain-driven design doesn’t go far enough.
    We chat about how you can see your team as customers to promote domain-driven
    design and then drill into what she does to create a ‘shared pool of knowledge’
    with her team. As Miki explains, ‘people problems’ are more difficult than technical
    ones and developers often make mistakes by not first developing common understanding.
    Especially when this relates to expectations within a company. Near the end of
    the episode, we explore what leaders can do to maintain productivity when growing
    their teams. Tune in to hear what you can do to deepen your team’s pool of understanding
    and improve the quality of your communication. \nNote: this episode was recorded
    in late July when Miki was working at Mode; she is now a Senior Software Engineer
    at Frame.io (https://frame.io).\nKey Points From This Episode:\nWhy homeschooling
    her kids better prepared Miki for software development than anything else.\nHow
    people within an organization express themselves through individual APIs. \nUnderstanding
    that people come from different backgrounds which influence their API.\nThe ‘shared
    pool of knowledge’ and figuring out how to communicate with people. \nMiki’s journey
    from homemaker to becoming a software engineer.\nHow nobody really knows what
    they’re doing.\nSecurity as a trade-off, privacy, and the power of two-factor
    authentication.\nHear about Miki’s work at the data science platform Mode.\nWhat
    Miki enjoys most about working in Elixir and what she uses it for. \nHow Miki
    sees architecture and the differences between architecture and design.\nDomain-driven
    design and the differences between data models and software. \nTreating your team
    ‘Agilely’ and seeing them as your customers.  \nMiki’s process of developing a
    shared pool of understanding before hammering out the end-to-end components. \nWhy
    ‘people problems’ are much more difficult than development problems. \nHow tech
    companies misdiagnose ‘people problems’ as bad design.\nConway’s Law and how code
    production reflects an organization’s structure. \nThe importance of setting expectations
    to maintain productivity as a team grows in size. \nThe danger of the Peter principle;
    when people are promoted to their level of incompetency.\nLinks Mentioned in Today’s

  description: "With ElixirConf 2020 just around the corner, today’s episode is a
    sneak peek where we talk with six of this year’s speakers. Each speaker gives
    listeners an elevator pitch of their talk while throwing in extra details about
    who their talk is aimed at, what they learned through the process, and which talks
    they’re excited about attending. \nOur first guest is Quinn Wilton, a developer
    at Tinfoil Security, whose talk is titled ‘Type-Safe LiveView with Gleam’. Quinn
    explains how she’s created a symbiosis between Elixir and Gleam that helps her
    create more consistent code while offsetting the disadvantages of dynamic typing.
    \nWe then chat with Dan Lindeman whose talk, ‘Short Circuit IoT Development Time
    with Nerves,’ is an overview of building custom hardware using Nerves and Elixir.
    \nAfter Dan’s plug on how you can start programming Nerves on your laptop, we
    welcome Jeffrey Utter to the show. His talk is a deep dive into ‘Debugging Live
    Systems on the Beam.’ Teasing out the topic, we discuss inefficiencies in the
    debugging process and how many developers adopt a ‘whack-a-mole’ approach to dealing
    with bugs. \nFrom debugging to UintSet, Luciano Ramalho, our next speaker, gives
    us a taste of his presentation, ‘UIntSet: enumerable, streamable, understandable.’
    Luciano shares how the Go language inspired him to experiment with leveraging
    protocols and streams to build new idiomatic Elixir data structures from scratch.
    He also touches on the importance of being humble when learning new languages
    and gearing Elixir to a non-engineer user base. \nAfter Luciano, we’re joined
    by Melvin Cedeno, a fellow Elixir Wizard from the SmartLogic family. Melvin brings
    his teaching experience to bear on the topic of ‘Teaching Functional Programming
    with Elixir.’ This is a key talk in growing our community, especially when considering
    the point that being an Elixir genius doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re well-suited
    to teach it. \nLast but certainly not least, we speak with Japa Swadia from Podium
    about her talk, ‘Domain-Driven Design with Elixir’ — a subject that’s been a huge
    focus on the podcast. We chat about what domain-driven design means and why it’s
    an important foundational concept for beginners to learn. \nTune in for this tip-of-the-iceberg
    preview. It’s just a glimpse into the varied and wonderfully informative talks
    you can expect at ElixirConf 2020.\nKey Points From This Episode:\nIntroducing
    Quinn Wilton who is using Gleam to interact with Elixir. \nHow being acquired
    by Synopsys has given Tinfoil Security access to greater resources.\nBalancing
    the advantages of Elixir with its drawbacks when it comes to dynamic analysis.\nWhat
    Gleam is and how it makes static typing more approachable. \nTeasing Quinn’s ElixirConf
    talk — ‘Talk Type-Safe LiveView with Gleam’\nWhat Quinn has learned from the process
    of creating his presentation. \nBuilding a dissembler and the talk that Quinn
    is most looking forward to attending.\nDan Lindeman’s work at Very making solar
    micro-grids.\nThe benefits of Elixir and Nerves when building custom hardware.
    \nWho Dan’s talk is aimed at and why it’s appropriate for any experience level.
    \nWorking with smart minds and laboring through hardware docs that often lie.
    \nHow scary it can be to work with hardware and the value of having your talk
    appeal to entry-level Elixir users. \nJeffrey Utter unpacks his talk — ‘Debugging
    Live Systems on the Beam.’\nHow most people play ‘whack-a-mole’ when dealing with
    live system bugs.\nUsing match specs to hone in on your debugging process. \nWhy
    most Elixir coders should learn about Jeffrey’s debugging system. \nWhy is Recon
    Library is such an excellent tool and its potential uses in distributed systems.\nHear
    which talks Jeffrey is looking forward to attending.\nHow Go inspired Luciano
    Ramalho to explore applying different data structures to Elixir.\nWhat skill-level
    Luciano’s talk is aimed at and why.\nDeveloping a sense of how Elixir is idiomatic,
    despite being such a new language.  \nBeing humble when learning new languages
    and the importance of protocols in understanding idiomatic data structures. \nHow
    Elixir is geared towards engineers which can create barriers of entry. \nMark
    Cedeno gives an elevator pitch for his talk — ‘Teaching Functional Programming
    with Elixir.’\nWhy knowing Elixir very well doesn’t mean that you can teach it.\nThe
    benefits of remote learning; it can make your teaching more organized and to-the-point.
    \nHear about the talks that Mark is excited about attending. \nJapa gives us a
    crash-course on domain-driven design.\nCreating a solid foundation for your app
    by considering the contexts in which it’s used.\nWhy beginners or those wanting
    to switch to domain-orientated coding should attend Japa’s talk.\nUsing schema
    to point to the same table in different contexts.\nWhich talks Japa is attending
    and how she got selected for ElixirConf 2020.\nLinks Mentioned in Today’s Episode:\nElixir

  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>With ElixirConf 2020 just around the corner, today’s
    episode is a sneak peek where we talk with six of this year’s speakers. Each speaker
    gives listeners an elevator pitch of their talk while throwing in extra details
    about who their talk is aimed at, what they learned through the process, and which
    talks they’re excited about attending. </p>\n\n<p>Our first guest is Quinn Wilton,
    a developer at Tinfoil Security, whose talk is titled ‘Type-Safe LiveView with
    Gleam’. Quinn explains how she’s created a symbiosis between Elixir and Gleam
    that helps her create more consistent code while offsetting the disadvantages
    of dynamic typing. </p>\n\n<p>We then chat with Dan Lindeman whose talk, ‘Short
    Circuit IoT Development Time with Nerves,’ is an overview of building custom hardware
    using Nerves and Elixir. </p>\n\n<p>After Dan’s plug on how you can start programming
    Nerves on your laptop, we welcome Jeffrey Utter to the show. His talk is a deep
    dive into ‘Debugging Live Systems on the Beam.’ Teasing out the topic, we discuss
    inefficiencies in the debugging process and how many developers adopt a ‘whack-a-mole’
    approach to dealing with bugs. </p>\n\n<p>From debugging to UintSet, Luciano Ramalho,
    our next speaker, gives us a taste of his presentation, ‘UIntSet: enumerable,
    streamable, understandable.’ Luciano shares how the Go language inspired him to
    experiment with leveraging protocols and streams to build new idiomatic Elixir
    data structures from scratch. He also touches on the importance of being humble
    when learning new languages and gearing Elixir to a non-engineer user base. </p>\n\n<p>After
    Luciano, we’re joined by Melvin Cedeno, a fellow Elixir Wizard from the SmartLogic
    family. Melvin brings his teaching experience to bear on the topic of ‘Teaching
    Functional Programming with Elixir.’ This is a key talk in growing our community,
    especially when considering the point that being an Elixir genius doesn’t necessarily
    mean that you’re well-suited to teach it. </p>\n\n<p>Last but certainly not least,
    we speak with Japa Swadia from Podium about her talk, ‘Domain-Driven Design with
    Elixir’ — a subject that’s been a huge focus on the podcast. We chat about what
    domain-driven design means and why it’s an important foundational concept for
    beginners to learn. </p>\n\n<p>Tune in for this tip-of-the-iceberg preview. It’s
    just a glimpse into the varied and wonderfully informative talks you can expect
    at ElixirConf 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Introducing
    Quinn Wilton who is using Gleam to interact with Elixir. </li>\n<li>How being
    acquired by Synopsys has given Tinfoil Security access to greater resources.</li>\n<li>Balancing
    the advantages of Elixir with its drawbacks when it comes to dynamic analysis.</li>\n<li>What
    Gleam is and how it makes static typing more approachable. </li>\n<li>Teasing
    Quinn’s ElixirConf talk — ‘Talk Type-Safe LiveView with Gleam’</li>\n<li>What
    Quinn has learned from the process of creating his presentation. </li>\n<li>Building
    a dissembler and the talk that Quinn is most looking forward to attending.</li>\n<li>Dan
    Lindeman’s work at Very making solar micro-grids.</li>\n<li>The benefits of Elixir
    and Nerves when building custom hardware. </li>\n<li>Who Dan’s talk is aimed at
    and why it’s appropriate for any experience level. </li>\n<li>Working with smart
    minds and laboring through hardware docs that often lie. </li>\n<li>How scary
    it can be to work with hardware and the value of having your talk appeal to entry-level
    Elixir users. </li>\n<li>Jeffrey Utter unpacks his talk — ‘Debugging Live Systems
    on the Beam.’</li>\n<li>How most people play ‘whack-a-mole’ when dealing with
    live system bugs.</li>\n<li>Using match specs to hone in on your debugging process.
    </li>\n<li>Why most Elixir coders should learn about Jeffrey’s debugging system.
    </li>\n<li>Why is Recon Library is such an excellent tool and its potential uses
    in distributed systems.</li>\n<li>Hear which talks Jeffrey is looking forward
    to attending.</li>\n<li>How Go inspired Luciano Ramalho to explore applying different
    data structures to Elixir.</li>\n<li>What skill-level Luciano’s talk is aimed
    at and why.</li>\n<li>Developing a sense of how Elixir is idiomatic, despite being
    such a new language.<br></li>\n<li>Being humble when learning new languages and
    the importance of protocols in understanding idiomatic data structures. </li>\n<li>How
    Elixir is geared towards engineers which can create barriers of entry. </li>\n<li>Mark
    Cedeno gives an elevator pitch for his talk — ‘Teaching Functional Programming
    with Elixir.’</li>\n<li>Why knowing Elixir very well doesn’t mean that you can
    teach it.</li>\n<li>The benefits of remote learning; it can make your teaching
    more organized and to-the-point. </li>\n<li>Hear about the talks that Mark is
    excited about attending. </li>\n<li>Japa gives us a crash-course on domain-driven
    design.</li>\n<li>Creating a solid foundation for your app by considering the
    contexts in which it’s used.</li>\n<li>Why beginners or those wanting to switch
    to domain-orientated coding should attend Japa’s talk.</li>\n<li>Using schema
    to point to the same table in different contexts.</li>\n<li>Which talks Japa is
    attending and how she got selected for ElixirConf 2020.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Links

  description: "Domain-driven design and extreme programming can help bridge the gap
    between development and business, and today we invite Mark Windholtz from Agile
    DNA to talk about how! Mark starts out by telling us about his early work in extreme
    programming before agile was a term and how he switched from Rails to Elixir after
    realizing its power for implementing domain-driven design. We take a deep dive
    with him into what these concepts mean, hearing him weigh in on how DDD can help
    architecture accommodate both development and business oriented complexities.
    For Mark, development and business teams must get a better understanding of each
    other’s jargon, and DDD is a way to accomplish this. The goal is to find a way
    of building a solid software core and to move away from features to systems thinking,
    whereby flexible software can make it more possible to do agile on the business
    side. We chat about some of the practices and principles that come into play when
    implementing DDD for Mark, and he details concepts like ubiquitous language, bounded
    contexts, and how to focus on the core domain by exploring models using tactical
    and strategic patterns. Along with this, Mark discusses users not being a domain
    concept, the challenges of getting new terms to stick in teams’ minds, and the
    task of refactoring code to reflect updated glossaries. Near the end of our conversation,
    Mark drills down on how DDD can optimize team efficiency. In closing, we get to
    know Chris Bell from ElixirTalk a little better in this week’s edition of Pattern
    Matching with Todd!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nThoughts on SpaceEx and their
    approach to engineering: system versus feature optimization.\nMark’s background
    in extreme programming, how he got started with AgileDNA, and the work they do
    there.\nA definition of extreme programming that adds engineering practices to
    Scrum.\nElixir’s superior ability to do DDD compared to Rails and how Mark got
    started using it.\nA brief introduction to domain-driven design, an approach to
    simplifying complex software.\nHow architecture needs to accommodate essential
    as well as accidental complexity.\nElixir’s ability to accommodate the building
    of domain models with well-separated code chunks.\nPrinciples of ubiquitous language
    and bounded contexts that make up DDD for Mark.\nUbiquitous language helps devs
    and businesspeople understand each other.\nBounded contexts: ‘Within this space,
    this world means this thing.’\nShifting focus from trying to make not all software,
    but core software, good.\nWhat patterns are applied to use principles of ubiquitous
    language and bounded contexts.\nFinding and focusing on the core domain by exploring
    models and how to do this using tactical and strategic patterns.\nThe consequences
    of users not being a domain concept which demands having a clearer language.\nChallenges
    of getting language and concepts to stick in business people’s minds.\nRefactoring
    code to reflect updated glossaries: Technical challenges teams doing DDD face.\nSwitching
    paradigms from feature-based optimizations to building an amazing code core.\nApproaches
    to modeling: the value of exploring multiple models.\nHow teams can become more
    efficient using DDD and extreme programming.\nFinal plugs from Mark and how Agile
    DNA can help use Elixir to implement DDD.\nPattern matching: Todd gets to know
    more about Chris Bell from ElixirTalk.\nHow Chris got into programming, what he’d
    do if not be a programmer, and more!\nWhy Chris loves history, dream pop, and
    what movie he’ll watch over and over.\nWhat project Chris is most excited about
    next: Building Settlers of Catan using LiveView.\nLinks Mentioned in Today’s Episode:\nElixir

    summary: "\n        <p>Domain-driven design and extreme programming can help bridge
      the gap between development and business, and today we invite Mark Windholtz
      from Agile DNA to talk about how! Mark starts out by telling us about his early
      work in extreme programming before agile was a term and how he switched from
      Rails to Elixir after realizing its power for implementing domain-driven design.
      We take a deep dive with him into what these concepts mean, hearing him weigh
      in on how DDD can help architecture accommodate both development and business
      oriented complexities. For Mark, development and business teams must get a better
      understanding of each other’s jargon, and DDD is a way to accomplish this. The
      goal is to find a way of building a solid software core and to move away from
      features to systems thinking, whereby flexible software can make it more possible
      to do agile on the business side. We chat about some of the practices and principles
      that come into play when implementing DDD for Mark, and he details concepts
      like ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, and how to focus on the core domain
      by exploring models using tactical and strategic patterns. Along with this,
      Mark discusses users not being a domain concept, the challenges of getting new
      terms to stick in teams’ minds, and the task of refactoring code to reflect
      updated glossaries. Near the end of our conversation, Mark drills down on how
      DDD can optimize team efficiency. In closing, we get to know Chris Bell from
      ElixirTalk a little better in this week’s edition of Pattern Matching with Todd!</p>\n\n<p>Key
      Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Thoughts on SpaceEx and their approach
      to engineering: system versus feature optimization.</li>\n<li>Mark’s background
      in extreme programming, how he got started with AgileDNA, and the work they
      do there.</li>\n<li>A definition of extreme programming that adds engineering
      practices to Scrum.</li>\n<li>Elixir’s superior ability to do DDD compared to
      Rails and how Mark got started using it.</li>\n<li>A brief introduction to domain-driven
      design, an approach to simplifying complex software.</li>\n<li>How architecture
      needs to accommodate essential as well as accidental complexity.</li>\n<li>Elixir’s
      ability to accommodate the building of domain models with well-separated code
      chunks.</li>\n<li>Principles of ubiquitous language and bounded contexts that
      make up DDD for Mark.</li>\n<li>Ubiquitous language helps devs and businesspeople
      understand each other.</li>\n<li>Bounded contexts: ‘Within this space, this
      world means this thing.’</li>\n<li>Shifting focus from trying to make not all
      software, but core software, good.</li>\n<li>What patterns are applied to use
      principles of ubiquitous language and bounded contexts.</li>\n<li>Finding and
      focusing on the core domain by exploring models and how to do this using tactical
      and strategic patterns.</li>\n<li>The consequences of users not being a domain
      concept which demands having a clearer language.</li>\n<li>Challenges of getting
      language and concepts to stick in business people’s minds.</li>\n<li>Refactoring
      code to reflect updated glossaries: Technical challenges teams doing DDD face.</li>\n<li>Switching
      paradigms from feature-based optimizations to building an amazing code core.</li>\n<li>Approaches
      to modeling: the value of exploring multiple models.</li>\n<li>How teams can
      become more efficient using DDD and extreme programming.</li>\n<li>Final plugs
      from Mark and how Agile DNA can help use Elixir to implement DDD.</li>\n<li>Pattern

  description: "Welcome to the second part of our special Elixir Wizards Dojo. A mashup
    made in partnership with ElixirConf Japan. In today’s episode, we talk to Nerves
    core team members Todd Resudek and Connor Rigby about all things Nerves. But first,
    Todd leads us into a delightful digression about his enjoyment of heavy metal
    music. From metal back to Nerves, Todd chats about how he uses Nerves to monitor
    his internet connection and to automatically restart his router when certain conditions
    are met. After talking about using Flutter and Dart to build GUIs, we ask Todd
    to share another of his Nerves projects; the future of sprinklers — the Drizzle
    2000! We then explore Connor’s self-defined role in the Nerves team as the development
    head of networking libraries before discussing how easy it is to use Nerves if
    you are an Elixir user. Todd and Connor dive into their utopian visions for the
    future of Nerves and why no other IoT solutions can compete with the tooling that
    Nerves provides. We talk about FarmBot and the many features that its models have,
    including how they can pulverize weeds. This springboards the conversion into
    the increasing importance of IoT tech in the agriculture sector and how it’s likely
    to be the next billion-dollar industry. We round off the episode by giving our
    guests the space to plug themselves and they close with a request for listeners
    to Iron Maiden and Metallica’s first albums. A perfect compliment to the first
    installment of the Elixir Wizards Dojo, tune in to learn more about the Nerves
    Project.\nKey Points From This Episode:\nIntroducing our guests and this episode’s
    connection to ElixirConf Japan. \nConnor and Todd lead a chat on the history and
    subgenres of heavy metal music.\nTodd talks about using Nerves to monitor his
    internet connection and restart his router.\nBuilding a user interface for Nerves’s
    projects using Flutter; Google’s UI toolkit. \nBest practices for developing apps
    with a specific focus on GUI apps.\nHear about the Drizzle 2000! Todd’s sprinkler
    controller system that runs on Nerves.\nTodd and Connor’s respective roles as
    a part of the Nerves core team. \nThe benefit of using Nerves; once it’s booted
    it’s a regular Elixir app. \nWhat a kiosk terminal is and how you would go about
    internationalizing one.\nExploring the future of Nerves and hardware development.\nComparing
    Nerves to other IoT solutions; in conclusion, nothing can compete. \nDifferent
    FarmBot system models that all use Nerves to grow food for you.\nUsing Nerves
    to encode and record video or to create a live stream. \nWhy integrating IoT into
    the agricultural sector will be the next billion-dollar industry.\nLinks Mentioned

    summary: "\n        <p>Welcome to the second part of our special Elixir Wizards
      Dojo. A mashup made in partnership with ElixirConf Japan. In today’s episode,
      we talk to Nerves core team members Todd Resudek and Connor Rigby about all
      things Nerves. But first, Todd leads us into a delightful digression about his
      enjoyment of heavy metal music. From metal back to Nerves, Todd chats about
      how he uses Nerves to monitor his internet connection and to automatically restart
      his router when certain conditions are met. After talking about using Flutter
      and Dart to build GUIs, we ask Todd to share another of his Nerves projects;
      the future of sprinklers — the Drizzle 2000! We then explore Connor’s self-defined
      role in the Nerves team as the development head of networking libraries before
      discussing how easy it is to use Nerves if you are an Elixir user. Todd and
      Connor dive into their utopian visions for the future of Nerves and why no other
      IoT solutions can compete with the tooling that Nerves provides. We talk about
      FarmBot and the many features that its models have, including how they can pulverize
      weeds. This springboards the conversion into the increasing importance of IoT
      tech in the agriculture sector and how it’s likely to be the next billion-dollar
      industry. We round off the episode by giving our guests the space to plug themselves
      and they close with a request for listeners to Iron Maiden and Metallica’s first
      albums. A perfect compliment to the first installment of the Elixir Wizards
      Dojo, tune in to learn more about the Nerves Project.</p>\n\n<p>Key Points From

  description: "Welcome to the first part of our extra special Elixir Wizards Dojo.
    A mashup made in partnership with ElixirConf Japan, in today’s episode, we pose
    questions asked by the Japanese Nerves community to Nerves core team members,
    Frank Hunleth and Justin Schneck. After introducing our guests, we talk about
    which companies make use of Nerve and explore its use cases by looking at FarmBot,
    an open source robotic farming tool. Justin and Frank take turns explaining the
    differences between soft and hard real-time — a springboard to show how Nerve
    excels within its ‘middle-ground of complexity’, production-orientated niche.
    From Halloween pranks to growing Sichuan chili peppers in the office, Justin and
    Frank share the projects that they’ve built using Nerves and emphasize its wide
    applicability. We discuss how Nerves has been both officially and unofficially
    ported to different devices, why people send Frank random pieces of hardware in
    the mail, and the differences between open-source and making your work publicly
    available. Justin and Frank commiserate over the challenge of working with Bluetooth
    and the beauty of the Nerves community in pushing innovation. We chat more about
    Nerves, including how you can extend the functionality of file systems, before
    Justin and Frank unpack their roadmap for Nerves’s future. Tune in to learn more
    about the Nerves Project, a system that can add a great deal of agility to any
    development cycle. \nKey Points From This Episode:\nIntroducing our guests and
    this episode’s focus on the Japanese Elixir community. \nThe double-edge of broadcasting
    your excitement about Elixir projects. \nLooking at FarmBot as a practical use-case
    to show off what Nerve can do.\nDifferences between soft and hard real-time using
    FarmBot as an example.\nWhat Nerves excels at; acting as a gateway for other processors.
    \nJustin and Frank share the projects that they’ve built using Nerves.\nA brief
    digression where Justin shares his love of Chinese Sichuan cooking. \nWhat other

    summary: "\n        <p>Welcome to the first part of our extra special Elixir Wizards
      Dojo. A mashup made in partnership with ElixirConf Japan, in today’s episode,
      we pose questions asked by the Japanese Nerves community to Nerves core team
      members, Frank Hunleth and Justin Schneck. After introducing our guests, we
      talk about which companies make use of Nerve and explore its use cases by looking
      at FarmBot, an open source robotic farming tool. Justin and Frank take turns
      explaining the differences between soft and hard real-time — a springboard to
      show how Nerve excels within its ‘middle-ground of complexity’, production-orientated
      niche. From Halloween pranks to growing Sichuan chili peppers in the office,
      Justin and Frank share the projects that they’ve built using Nerves and emphasize
      its wide applicability. We discuss how Nerves has been both officially and unofficially
      ported to different devices, why people send Frank random pieces of hardware
      in the mail, and the differences between open-source and making your work publicly
      available. Justin and Frank commiserate over the challenge of working with Bluetooth
      and the beauty of the Nerves community in pushing innovation. We chat more about
      Nerves, including how you can extend the functionality of file systems, before
      Justin and Frank unpack their roadmap for Nerves’s future. Tune in to learn
      more about the Nerves Project, a system that can add a great deal of agility
      to any development cycle. </p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Introducing
      our guests and this episode’s focus on the Japanese Elixir community. </li>\n<li>The
      double-edge of broadcasting your excitement about Elixir projects. </li>\n<li>Looking
      at FarmBot as a practical use-case to show off what Nerve can do.</li>\n<li>Differences
      between soft and hard real-time using FarmBot as an example.</li>\n<li>What
      Nerves excels at; acting as a gateway for other processors. </li>\n<li>Justin
      and Frank share the projects that they’ve built using Nerves.</li>\n<li>A brief
      digression where Justin shares his love of Chinese Sichuan cooking. </li>\n<li>What
      other markets are making use of Nerves in their product cycle.</li>\n<li>The
      unique ‘middle-ground’ of complexity that Nerves is best suited to address.

  description: "In today’s episode, we chat about system architecture, Ruby, Elixir,
    and everything in between with Greg Mefford, the senior back-end engineer for
    the Bleacher Report. We open the conversation by asking Greg about his start in
    coding, leading to a story about how Greg was that bored kid pressuring a math
    teacher to teach him QBasic. He shares how he fell in love with Ruby before discovering
    Elixir and Nerves. Having faced some challenges when learning Nerves, Greg talks
    about how he began documenting his pain points and writing documents to help onboard
    newcomers. We discuss Greg’s work with Nerves, his project aspirations, and his
    recommended resources for anyone looking to get into Nerves or Elixir. After providing
    his hot take on the latest Code BEAM V conference, we ask Greg what system architecture
    means to him. From there we get super meta about the meaning of architecture and
    what it means to translate design into practice. We touch on the struggle of understanding
    domain-driven design and Greg’s approach to pre-code planning before delving into
    how the Bleacher Report is set up. As Greg goes into details, you’ll hear why
    their servers now run on Elixir and not Ruby. Near the end of the episode, we
    talk about Poncho versus Umbrella apps, and Greg shares his passion for multi-user
    dungeons (MUDs). Tune in to learn more about Greg and his role in the Elixir and

  description: "Johanna Larsson is a community-minded software engineer whose project,
    Hex Diff, generates highlighted git diffs, right in your browser. In this episode,
    we talk to Johanna about how Hex Diff can benefit Elixir users, the differences
    between code architecture and code design, and the debatably under-appreciated
    role of Elixir umbrella apps. We start the conversation by chatting with Johanna
    about her recent move to London and her work for Duffel; a startup helping travel
    agencies book trips. After talking about how she got into software development,
    we dive into Hex Diff versus GitHub, with Joanna detailing how Hex Diff offers
    greater security for your code. We ask Johanna about the origins of the Hex Diff
    project and she explores its aims and her experiences working on the project.
    In line with this month’s theme, we discuss what architecture means to Joanna
    and the need for domain-driven design. We quiz Joanna on her approaches to problem-solving
    and she explains how her coding process emphasizes building an early prototype
    and constantly iterating on it. Despite hearing that umbrella apps are bad news,
    Joanna makes a case for their value while acknowledging how that they need greater
    tooling. We round off our conversation by asking Joanna how she tries to grow
    her skillset and what her favorite Elixir resource is. Following our discussion
    with Johanna, we open with another edition of Pattern Matching with Todd. This
    week, friend of the podcast Todd Resudek asks five questions of Elixir community
    member Bruce Williams. They talk about Bruce’s work as an Arabic cryptologic linguist
    for the US Airforce, his software career, and the therapeutic uses of playing
    Animal Crossing during a pandemic. \nKey Points From This Episode:\nWe introduce
    Johanna Larsson and she shares how she is doing in London. \nHow Johanna developed
    a love for software and how Elixir brought her to London. \nDetails about Johanna’s
    job at Duffel; a startup that helps travel companies book trips. \nHow Hex Diff
    is solving problems that arise when using code from GitHub.\nJohanna’s experience
    working on Hex Diff and the problems that they aim to solve.\nHex Diff’s caching
    system and what Hex Diff does to counter malicious software uploads.\nThe disconnect

    summary: "\n        <p>Johanna Larsson is a community-minded software engineer
      whose project, Hex Diff, generates highlighted git diffs, right in your browser.
      In this episode, we talk to Johanna about how Hex Diff can benefit Elixir users,
      the differences between code architecture and code design, and the debatably
      under-appreciated role of Elixir umbrella apps. We start the conversation by
      chatting with Johanna about her recent move to London and her work for Duffel;
      a startup helping travel agencies book trips. After talking about how she got
      into software development, we dive into Hex Diff versus GitHub, with Joanna
      detailing how Hex Diff offers greater security for your code. We ask Johanna
      about the origins of the Hex Diff project and she explores its aims and her
      experiences working on the project. In line with this month’s theme, we discuss
      what architecture means to Joanna and the need for domain-driven design. We
      quiz Joanna on her approaches to problem-solving and she explains how her coding
      process emphasizes building an early prototype and constantly iterating on it.
      Despite hearing that umbrella apps are bad news, Joanna makes a case for their
      value while acknowledging how that they need greater tooling. We round off our
      conversation by asking Joanna how she tries to grow her skillset and what her
      favorite Elixir resource is. Following our discussion with Johanna, we open
      with another edition of Pattern Matching with Todd. This week, friend of the
      podcast Todd Resudek asks five questions of Elixir community member Bruce Williams.
      They talk about Bruce’s work as an Arabic cryptologic linguist for the US Airforce,
      his software career, and the therapeutic uses of playing Animal Crossing during
      a pandemic. </p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We introduce
      Johanna Larsson and she shares how she is doing in London. </li>\n<li>How Johanna

  description: "Handling date and time is a challenge in any language, but Lau Taarnskov
    is determined to solve that problem in Elixir. Lau is today’s guest on Elixir
    Wizards, and this episode is all about his contributions to Elixir. Lau has been
    involved with web development and e-commerce for decades. He started contributing
    to Elixir open source in 2014 and created the Calendar and tzdata libraries. Calendar
    is a datetime library for Elixir, that provides explicit types for datetimes,
    dates, and times, and full time zone support is provided via its sister package,
    tzdata. When it comes to the subject of date, time, and time zones, besides talking
    about it and writing software for it, Lau also writes about it on his blog, Creative
    Deletion. \nThis episode explores how Lau got started in programming, and what
    led him to creating Calendar and tzdata. Lau shares the resources that he found
    helpful when he started using Elixir, and why he was drawn to Elixir in the first
    place. We hear Lau’s opinions on time zones and daylight savings and whether or
    not they’re necessary, and he shares some advice for anyone working with time
    in Elixir. \nThen it’s time for another edition of Pattern Matching with Todd,
    in which Todd Resudek asks Brooklyn Zekanka five questions to help us get to know
    her better. Brooklyn talks about everything from she has lived, what jobs she
    did before becoming a programmer, and her education in classical music, to her
    favorite bands, movies, and TV shows, as well as some of the projects she is working
    on. For all this, and more, don’t miss today’s episode! \nKey Points From This
    Episode: \nLau explains what TLAs are and why they aren’t always helpful for explicit
    communication. \nLau introduces himself and shares how he got into programming
    and computer science. \nThe resources Lau found most useful when he started using
    Elixir, including books he read. \nWhat it means that Elixir’s source code is
    written in Elixir, and why that was helpful for Lau. \nLu talks about Calendar,
    a datetime library that Lau created for Elixir, and Tzdata, a parser and library
    he created for the tz database, and why he created them. \nHow Lau deconstructed
    the time zone problems and how his ideas have changed over time. \nLau’s opinions
    on time zones and daylight savings and whether or not they’re necessary. \nAdvice
    from Lau for anyone working with time in Elixir. \nAnother edition of Pattern
    Matching with Todd – today’s guest is Brooklyn Zelenka. \nWhere Brooklyn was born,
    where she has lived, and the jobs she did before programming. \nBrooklyn talks
    about her musical background and how it’s similar to programming. \nBrooklyn shares
    a pro tip about slides and reflects on her highlights as a speaker. \nWhat Brooklyn
    would be doing if she weren’t a programmer and the genre of music she likes. \nBrooklyn’s
    favorite TV shows and movies, including Amadeus and Mad Men. \nBrooklyn shares
    what she’s working on currently and the next project she’s excited about. \nLinks

    summary: "\n        <p>Handling date and time is a challenge in any language,
      but Lau Taarnskov is determined to solve that problem in Elixir. Lau is today’s
      guest on Elixir Wizards, and this episode is all about his contributions to
      Elixir. Lau has been involved with web development and e-commerce for decades.
      He started contributing to Elixir open source in 2014 and created the Calendar
      and tzdata libraries. Calendar is a datetime library for Elixir, that provides
      explicit types for datetimes, dates, and times, and full time zone support is
      provided via its sister package, tzdata. When it comes to the subject of date,
      time, and time zones, besides talking about it and writing software for it,
      Lau also writes about it on his blog, Creative Deletion. </p>\n\n<p>This episode
      explores how Lau got started in programming, and what led him to creating Calendar
      and tzdata. Lau shares the resources that he found helpful when he started using
      Elixir, and why he was drawn to Elixir in the first place. We hear Lau’s opinions
      on time zones and daylight savings and whether or not they’re necessary, and
      he shares some advice for anyone working with time in Elixir. </p>\n\n<p>Then
      it’s time for another edition of Pattern Matching with Todd, in which Todd Resudek
      asks Brooklyn Zekanka five questions to help us get to know her better. Brooklyn
      talks about everything from she has lived, what jobs she did before becoming
      a programmer, and her education in classical music, to her favorite bands, movies,
      and TV shows, as well as some of the projects she is working on. For all this,
      and more, don’t miss today’s episode! </p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:
      </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lau explains what TLAs are and why they aren’t always helpful
      for explicit communication. </li>\n<li>Lau introduces himself and shares how
      he got into programming and computer science. </li>\n<li>The resources Lau found
      most useful when he started using Elixir, including books he read. </li>\n<li>What
      it means that Elixir’s source code is written in Elixir, and why that was helpful
      for Lau. </li>\n<li>Lu talks about Calendar, a datetime library that Lau created
      for Elixir, and Tzdata, a parser and library he created for the tz database,
      and why he created them. </li>\n<li>How Lau deconstructed the time zone problems
      and how his ideas have changed over time. </li>\n<li>Lau’s opinions on time
      zones and daylight savings and whether or not they’re necessary. </li>\n<li>Advice
      from Lau for anyone working with time in Elixir. </li>\n<li>Another edition
      of Pattern Matching with Todd – today’s guest is Brooklyn Zelenka. </li>\n<li>Where
      Brooklyn was born, where she has lived, and the jobs she did before programming.
      </li>\n<li>Brooklyn talks about her musical background and how it’s similar
      to programming. </li>\n<li>Brooklyn shares a pro tip about slides and reflects
      on her highlights as a speaker. </li>\n<li>What Brooklyn would be doing if she
      weren’t a programmer and the genre of music she likes. </li>\n<li>Brooklyn’s
      favorite TV shows and movies, including Amadeus and Mad Men. </li>\n<li>Brooklyn

  description: "For part 2 of our Council of Wizards panel discussion, we are joined
    by Chris Bell, Desmond Bowe, Emily Maxie, Dan Lindeman, and Alan Voss! Chris and
    Desmond run the ElixirTalk Podcast and we get in-depth on the intersection of
    the language and talking about it. They share the lessons they have learned in
    the podcasting space, making some pit stops to chat about aliens, Elixir beef,
    and marble flooring! We discuss the community during the pandemic and what the
    Elixir world might look like for the next year or two. Emily and Dan then step
    in to give us all the information about Very and their very functional remote
    work model. They talk us through the full departure that the company made from
    a physical hub and both share what they love and hate about working from home,
    before and during the COVID crisis. Dan and Emily talk about onboarding and team
    spirit in remote teams and the strategies that have best served Very in this regard.
    Lastly, we have a bonus section with Alan Voss, to discuss his game night competitions
    and more. He unpacks the games he has already hosted and some of the candidates
    for future events before we hear about his experiences in the pandemic, specifically
    as an extrovert and a father. For all of this make sure to join us on the show!\nKey

  description: "The Elixir community continues to flourish and evolve in these uncertain
    times and in honor of this we have put together a live show with a number of special
    guests! In part one today, we are joined by Andrea Leopardi and René Föhring,
    who we are so happy to welcome back. We get the lowdown from each of them in turn,
    discussing personal preferences, tips and tricks, and recommendations for Elixir
    and beyond. Andrea gets into some of his pet peeves and comments on the trend
    of slow interfaces. We then look at future possibilities for Elixir including
    the outside chance of it being run on mobile and for crypto-mining! Andrea also
    updates us on the book he is currently working on so keep an eye out for that
    in the future! René then steps in to talk about his work on Credo, his hopes for
    it in the future, and some suggestions for listeners using it. We do some comparisons
    between Elixir and Ruby before René offers some thoughts on Electron and functional
    programming concepts. So for all this and a whole lot more, make sure to tune
    in today and stay tuned for part 2!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nA reintroduction
    to Andrea and his current work in the Elixir space.\nAndrea's tool recommendations
    and what he uses most at the moment. \nUpdates, the short term future of the world
    of Elixir and Andrea's current focus.\nRSpec versus xUnit: Andrea's personal preferences.
    \nAndrea's limited experience of LiveView and early reactions.\nFeelings about
    computers and phones with slow interfaces!\nThe very slim chances of seeing Elixir
    run on mobile. \nCryptocurrency and Andrea's lack of experience and ambition in
    the space.  \nSome exciting information about Andrea's upcoming book to keep an
    eye out for. \nRené's current projects; Credo, Elixir weekly newsletter, and more!
    \nThe future of Elixir — will it be the next Ruby? \nElixir on a phone; René's
    thoughts on this possibility and its validity. \nUpdates for Credo — all the exciting
    news since our last conversation with René. \nImproving work that you are proud
    of and René's own feelings about Credo.\nThe objectives and vision for Credo and
    improving upon certain pain points. \nWriting and running in Electron and how
    to have fun while doing it!\nThe application of functional programming concepts
    in René's work in Electron.\nRené's suggestion for Credo — using the Credo master
    after it being reworked.\nLinks Mentioned in Today’s Episode:\nSmartLogic — https://smartlogic.io/

  description: "Although it’s taken him four seasons to make an appearance, we are
    so glad to finally welcome Chris McCord, creator of the Phoenix framework, onto
    the show. While this season’s focus is on system and application architecture,
    today’s discussion deviates to focus on Phoenix. We get started by hearing more
    about Chris’s programming journey, all the way from TI-Basic to where he is now.
    After this, we dive into LiveView, the project Chris is currently focusing most
    of his energy on. We get into some of the incredible changes that have been made
    including live navigation, deep change tracking optimizations, and static asset
    tracking. Chris shares which of the changes he is most excited about, along with
    why he enjoys seeing LiveView being misused. We then look at some of the critiques
    of LiveView and Phoenix generally. Chris offers counter-arguments to the most
    common criticisms of the framework. He shares how the title of 'framework' can
    be a double-edged sword, as well as why he is hesitant to extract channels prematurely.
    We wrap the show up with a look into the future, hearing more about what’s on
    the horizon for Phoenix and where Chris hopes the Elixir community is headed.
    This conversation was well worth the four season-long wait, so be sure to tune
    in today!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nWhy it took Chris four whole seasons
    to finally make an appearance on the show.\nChris’s programming journey from T-Basic
    all the way to Java, HTML, and PHP.\nHow a broken back landed Chris his first
    paid programming job.\nLearn more about Chris’s current project, LiveView, and
    some of the recent additions.\nWhy the optimizations were the most interesting
    changes for Chris to make on LiveView.\nSome of the most interesting use cases
    Chris has seen of LiveView.\nHow Chris plans to navigate laying LiveView out on
    a larger codebase.\nChris’s take on stateful applications and why the platform
    is so important.\nThe origins of the hilariously termed ‘dead view.’\nSome of
    the most pertinent critiques of LiveView and Phoenix generally.\nChris busts some
    of the invalid critiques of Phoenix.\nWhy the community feedback on LiveWire has
    been so surprising to Chris.\nPhoenix 1.6 changes and when we can expect its release.\nChris’s
    take on whether Elixir is likely to overthrow Rails in terms of popularity.\nThe
    systemic blockers that create adoption friction of Elixir and Phoenix.\nLooking
    into the future — Chris’s goals for Phoenix and his hopes for the Elixir community.\nLinks

      most of his energy on. We get into some of the incredible changes that have
      been made including live navigation, deep change tracking optimizations, and
      static asset tracking. Chris shares which of the changes he is most excited
      about, along with why he enjoys seeing LiveView being misused. We then look
      at some of the critiques of LiveView and Phoenix generally. Chris offers counter-arguments
      to the most common criticisms of the framework. He shares how the title of &#39;framework&#39;
      can be a double-edged sword, as well as why he is hesitant to extract channels
      prematurely. We wrap the show up with a look into the future, hearing more about

    on the Elixir Outlaws and This Agile Life podcasts. This episode is centered around
    a casual conversation about everything from programming, the military, sarcasm,
    and puns to systems and application architecture, domain-driven design, and bitmasks.
    Amos shares with us how he got into programming, after wanting to be a doctor
    or an engineer first, and tells us how he met Famous Amos. We talk about spectrum
    analyzers, Elixir resources, and MUDs, as well as type-first design and Haskell.
    Amos gives us his takes on domain-driven design, API, booleans, and enums, and
    even roasts his co-host Chris Keithley a little. Don’t miss this episode for everything
    you’ve ever wanted to know about the legendary Amos King (and a whole lot more)!\nKey
    Points From This Episode:\n* Amos explains what Adkron means, which is his gaming
    and social media handle.\n* Where the name Elixir Outlaws for the podcast came
    from.\n* How Amos got into programming as a career, after wanting to be a surgeon
    and an engineer.\n* What Amos’s first opportunity as a programmer was, and how
    he met Wally Amos.\n* Amos explains what a spectrum analyzer is, based on his
    experience in the military.\n* Amos shares why Steve Bussey’s book, Real-Time

    engine that they worked on together.\n* What systems and application architecture
    means to Amos and how it differs from design.\n* What type-first design (TFD)
    is and Amos’s opinion on it as a thought exercise.\n* Amos talks about Haskell
    programming and domain-driven design.\n* Relating domain-driven design to a car
    dealership to describe types and terminology.\n* Amos talks a bit about his company
    and what they do.\n* Justus, Eric, and Amos debate the term “architect” and what
    it actually means.\n* Amos shares his take on API architecture, booleans, enums,
    and bitmasks.\n* Amos gives his hot take on his co-host Chris Keithley.\nLinks

  description: "Dave Thomas is recognized internationally as an expert who develops
    high-quality software–accurate and highly flexible systems. He helped write the
    now-famous Agile Manifesto, and regularly gives inspiring and controversial speeches
    on new ways of producing software. He is the author of six books, including the
    best selling The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master and Programming
    Ruby: A Pragmatic Programmer's Guide. In this episode, we discuss everything from
    learning computer science in an academic setting, test-driven development, and
    state to architecture, libraries, and what Dave loves about what he does. Dave
    talks about his students, both those who are passionate and those who are just
    going through the motions, as well as his own experience of being a student. He
    explains to us what he means when he said he doesn’t write unit tests at an Elixir
    conference in Austin recently, we talk about his favorite and most rewarding books,
    and Dave gives us a really unique answer to our architecture question. We discuss
    domain-driven design, microservice architectures, and Elixir libraries, and Dave
    shares why is so passionate about what he does. Tune in to hear some of Dave’s
    strong opinions on programming!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nThe Coding Gnome
    and how it bridges the gap between learned and practical experience.\nDave talks
    about being a lecturer at SMU and why students aren’t prepared for the real world.\nWhy
    Dave stopped teaching Elixir at SMU.\nStudents who study computer science for
    passion versus those who study it to get a job.\nDave talks about his experience
    of studying computer science at university.\nThe inspiring and controversial keynote
    addresses Dave has given at conferences.\nWhat it means when Dave said he doesn’t
    write unit tests and the projects he’s working on.\nThe culture around test-driven
    development and writing tests when Dave was at university.\nDave tells a story
    about writing the incoming telex switch for the UK.\nWhy the first edition of
    Programming Ruby was Dave’s favorite book to write.\nWhy The Pragmatic Programmer
    is the book Dave is most proud of.\nDave isn’t currently writing a new book, so
    he can concentrate on pseudo-course material.\nDave explains the process of developing
    a narrative arc when writing a technical book.\nWhat the state of a system is
    and how it is distinct from data.\nDave describes why he believes architecture
    is a misunderstood and borrowed metaphor.\nDave’s opinions on buzzwords like domain-driven
    design and microservice architectures.\nThe status on The Component Library, as
    mentioned by Dave in his EMPEX 2018 keynote.\nGetting involved with publishing
    Elixir libraries and what his process looks like.\nHow Dave likes to receive product
    specification when dealing with clients.\nWhat Dave loves about the programming
    industry.\nWhy Dave doesn’t write Elixir anymore and why he became frustrated
    with it.\nWhere Dave is going from here to how best to express what he wants.\nFinal
    advice from Dave, not to abandon Elixir if it makes you happy.\nLinks Mentioned

  description: "Joining us on the show for this episode is Ben Marx, author of Adopting
    Elixir and Principal Control Plane Engineer at the recently launched SubSpace!
    We continue our Season 4 journey into system and application architecture with
    Ben and he unpacks what he can about the somewhat still under wraps work at the
    new company. Ben is all about plain-spoken and easy to understand conversations
    on these topics, preferring to avoid highfalutin and confusing terms with multiple
    interpretations. He really drills down on his understanding of the fundamentals
    of his work and we also get to hear about his previous position at Bleacher Report.
    He unpacks the lessons he took away from the company, and the changes he witnessed
    while there. Ben explains how Elixir fits into the work at SubSpace and what a
    perfect fit it is for their low-latency service. We also spend a bit of time talking
    about life as an introverted programmer, attending conferences and meeting people,
    and remote work and family life during the pandemic. For all this and then some,
    tune in today!\nKey Points From This Episode:\n* Ben's exciting new position at
    SubSpace, and how the company reduces latency.\n* The increasing need for more
    reliable internet speeds during the pandemic.\n* Use of Elixir for SubSpace and
    how well it fits the needs of the company.\n* The engineering team at SubSpace
    and some of the basic system architecture. \n* Meeting people, giving talks and
    life at conferences as an introvert.  \n* The meaning of architecture to Ben;
    more dynamic than static. \n* Differentiating between architecture and design;
    the abstract and reality.\n* The idea of domain-driven design what the concept
    means to Ben.\n* Placement of the authentication and authorization systems.\n*
    Ben's time working at Bleacher Report and the development of the company during
    his time there.\n* Thoughts on Kafka and its baffling name! \n* Ben's new role
    at SubSpace and major areas of learning for him so far.\n* Adapting to a new role
    during the work from home era; life under quarantine. \n* Project management and
    helpful processes for remote work in a new world. \n* Ideas for another book from
    Ben, his belief in Elixir and getting in contact! \nLinks Mentioned in Today’s

  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>Joining us on the show for this episode is Ben Marx,
    author of Adopting Elixir and Principal Control Plane Engineer at the recently
    launched SubSpace! We continue our Season 4 journey into system and application
    architecture with Ben and he unpacks what he can about the somewhat still under
    wraps work at the new company. Ben is all about plain-spoken and easy to understand
    conversations on these topics, preferring to avoid highfalutin and confusing terms
    with multiple interpretations. He really drills down on his understanding of the
    fundamentals of his work and we also get to hear about his previous position at
    Bleacher Report. He unpacks the lessons he took away from the company, and the
    changes he witnessed while there. Ben explains how Elixir fits into the work at
    SubSpace and what a perfect fit it is for their low-latency service. We also spend
    a bit of time talking about life as an introverted programmer, attending conferences
    and meeting people, and remote work and family life during the pandemic. For all
    this and then some, tune in today!</p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ben&#39;s
    exciting new position at SubSpace, and how the company reduces latency.</li>\n<li>The
    increasing need for more reliable internet speeds during the pandemic.</li>\n<li>Use
    of Elixir for SubSpace and how well it fits the needs of the company.</li>\n<li>The
    engineering team at SubSpace and some of the basic system architecture. </li>\n<li>Meeting
    people, giving talks and life at conferences as an introvert.<br></li>\n<li>The
    meaning of architecture to Ben; more dynamic than static. </li>\n<li>Differentiating
    between architecture and design; the abstract and reality.</li>\n<li>The idea
    of domain-driven design what the concept means to Ben.</li>\n<li>Placement of
    the authentication and authorization systems.</li>\n<li>Ben&#39;s time working
    at Bleacher Report and the development of the company during his time there.</li>\n<li>Thoughts
    on Kafka and its baffling name! </li>\n<li>Ben&#39;s new role at SubSpace and
    major areas of learning for him so far.</li>\n<li>Adapting to a new role during
    the work from home era; life under quarantine. </li>\n<li>Project management and
    helpful processes for remote work in a new world. </li>\n<li>Ideas for another
    book from Ben, his belief in Elixir and getting in contact! </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Links

    Today’s guest is Mohd Maqbool Alam, a software developer and Elixir fan from Delhi. He enjoys learning about programming language theory, distributed systems, Cloud Native technologies, and open source. As he is working towards building an Elixir community in Delhi, we caught up with him to find out how he came to be part of the Elixir world, and what drew him to programming in the first place. We also discuss Maqbool’s favorite Elixir resources and how Elixir has changed the way he thinks about architecture applications, as well as his opinions on microservices, APIs, and static typing. We talk about the real-world consequences of programming, using Neil Ferguson’s pandemic simulation model as an example, and Maqbool shares his favorite RPC (when we actually meant to ask him his favorite RFC)! The episode concludes with Pattern Matching with Todd. In this edition, he discusses Kubernetes and Beam with Principal Software Architect Cory O’Daniel.

  description: "As our first trilogy comes to a close, and we embark on the next one,
    we’re doing what all great trilogies do: Upending everything that made the initial
    one great and starting afresh. We have taken on board some excellent listener
    feedback to keep this the highest quality Elixir related podcast. So, for this
    launchisode, rather than doing a trailer, we are diving in headfirst with a full
    episode on system and application architecture, this season’s theme, with Justus
    Eapen, Dan Ivovich, and Eric Oestrich. \nWe kick off the show by getting to know
    Dan and Eric a bit better. This season, as per listener requests, we will spend
    more time on our guests' personal lives. We learn about Dan and Eric’s time at
    SmartLogic, their experience working with Elixir, and their approaches to learning
    it. From there, we move onto tackling clients’ projects. We discuss the importance
    of letting ideas flow free as well as how to break projects down into manageable
    sized segments to work on. Following this, we touch on flexible architecture.
    As the world changes, sometimes at a pace faster than we anticipate, it is more
    important than ever to design systems that we can iterate on. Then, we discuss
    the future of applications and architecture and the exciting possibilities in-store.
    \nThe show rounds off with our new segment, Pattern Matching with Todd, where
    our friend Todd Resudek gets to know someone in the community a bit better. Today,
    he talks with Connor Rigby of Binary Noggin, finding out more about his programing
    journey, his favorite music and movies, and his WiFi meshing project. We're so
    excited for this season, and we hope you join us on the journey. Tune in today!\nKey
    Points From This Episode:\nDan’s background and how he came to be Director of
    Development Operations.\nHow Eric started at SmartLogic and what his journey at
    the company has been like.\nLearn what convinced Dan to go all-in on Elixir and
    make the move from Rails\nSome of the educational materials and tools Dan and
    Eric used to learn Elixir.\nDan’s preferred style of design and why he enjoys
    TDD.\nWhy we think that Cucumber falls short and chose to move away from it.\nFind
    out what we think domain-driven design is.\nHow Dan and Eric approach deconstructing
    clients’ projects.\nPre-coding: Why it’s best to do free-form planning, with no
    constraints.\nInsights into the broad-reaching term of ‘API’ and what we mean
    by it.\nSOAP and REST APIs: What they are and the differences between them.\nHow
    Dan, Eric, and Justus’s thinking about designing and application architecture
    has evolved.\nObject-oriented programming versus functional: Our take on the age-old
    debate.\nIs this finally the year that we get to kill micro-services?\nThe relationship
    between team size and micro-services and some other constraints.\nWhat the future
    has in store for applications and architecting.\nPattern-matching with Todd: Five
    questions to get to know Connor Rigby a bit better.\nLinks Mentioned in Today’s

    summary: "\n        <p>As our first trilogy comes to a close, and we embark on
      the next one, we’re doing what all great trilogies do: Upending everything that
      made the initial one great and starting afresh. We have taken on board some
      excellent listener feedback to keep this the highest quality Elixir related
      podcast. So, for this launchisode, rather than doing a trailer, we are diving
      in headfirst with a full episode on system and application architecture, this
      season’s theme, with Justus Eapen, Dan Ivovich, and Eric Oestrich. </p>\n\n<p>We
      kick off the show by getting to know Dan and Eric a bit better. This season,
      as per listener requests, we will spend more time on our guests&#39; personal
      lives. We learn about Dan and Eric’s time at SmartLogic, their experience working
      with Elixir, and their approaches to learning it. From there, we move onto tackling
      clients’ projects. We discuss the importance of letting ideas flow free as well
      as how to break projects down into manageable sized segments to work on. Following
      this, we touch on flexible architecture. As the world changes, sometimes at
      a pace faster than we anticipate, it is more important than ever to design systems
      that we can iterate on. Then, we discuss the future of applications and architecture
      and the exciting possibilities in-store. </p>\n\n<p>The show rounds off with
      our new segment, Pattern Matching with Todd, where our friend Todd Resudek gets
      to know someone in the community a bit better. Today, he talks with Connor Rigby
      of Binary Noggin, finding out more about his programing journey, his favorite
      music and movies, and his WiFi meshing project. We&#39;re so excited for this
      season, and we hope you join us on the journey. Tune in today!</p>\n\n<p>Key
      Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dan’s background and how he came
      to be Director of Development Operations.</li>\n<li>How Eric started at SmartLogic
      and what his journey at the company has been like.</li>\n<li>Learn what convinced
      Dan to go all-in on Elixir and make the move from Rails</li>\n<li>Some of the
      educational materials and tools Dan and Eric used to learn Elixir.</li>\n<li>Dan’s
      preferred style of design and why he enjoys TDD.</li>\n<li>Why we think that

    Welcome back to part two of our betweenisode! Everybody is working remotely now including ourselves, so today we continue the catch ups we were having with a number of longstanding buddies and chat about life after social distancing! The show is a back-to-back of four different conversations, the first being with Amos King, Chris Keathley, and Anna Neyzberg from Elixir Outlaws. After that we talk to Paul Schoenfelder, before getting on the line with Sophie DeBenedetto and Meryl Dakin. Last but not least we catch up with Dave Thomas. Our four conversations cover the same broad themes, and we mostly share our thoughts about what is happening in the world right now, how we are coping with working remotely, and what particular projects have been keeping us busy. Our guests share varying perspectives about what it means that we are restructuring the way we do things. We talk about how even if you worked remotely before, things feel different now, and we also consider the extra burdens of being a remote software developer. Other topics include the line between complaints and constructive criticism, wild animals roaming the streets, and the general atmosphere in our different locations. From a tech point of view, we touch on IoT development, various GitHub projects to get involved with, why students aren’t learning how to program properly anymore, and a lot more. Get it all here and make sure you stay tuned for episode one of season four!
    Key Points From This Episode:
    Scaling up the NFL Draft website for remote screening.
    Home life and side projects in the quarantine: Mogde Podge, a baby, and game development.
    Shameless plugs from everybody: Binary Noggin, ElixirBridge, and Finch.
    Isolation, low supplies and trying to stay positive at present.
    Imagining roaming wild animals now that humans are in quarantine.
    Advice from Paul who works at home for surviving social distancing.
    What Paul is doing for Ockam to secure IoT devices.
    The danger of starting hack vulnerable tech companies.
    A plug from Paul to get involved with Lumen.
    Nature taking over; Meryl and Sophie’s experiences in Brooklyn and Westchester right now.
    Working from home versus working from home due to a global crisis.
    Domestic squabbles over bandwidth between Meryl and her software developer brother.
    Lessons learned to stay sane during quarantine: getting dressed.
    Extra tasks remote developers are having to do remotely; becoming project managers.
    The difference between complaints and legitimate critiques of work systems.
    Dave’s amazing remote communications setup 40 miles north of Dallas.
    The situation where Dave is with regard to coronavirus and freedom.
    How COBOL has not become too broad despite not using libraries.
    The history of programming languages that Dave teaches.
    That PDP-11 runs better emulated in Javascript than in its original hardware.
    A drawback of modern development: not understanding hardware.
    How Dave is digitizing his SMU courses due to teaching them online at present.
    All the effort Dave puts into grading his students’ exercises.
    Issues that coding is not taught rigorously enough; students can’t ‘program’.
    How well the human race is doing to mobilize en masse right now.
    Whether tech caused the crisis and humanity could manage this crisis 100 years ago.

      us busy. Our guests share varying perspectives about what it means that we are
      restructuring the way we do things. We talk about how even if you worked remotely
      before, things feel different now, and we also consider the extra burdens of
      being a remote software developer. Other topics include the line between complaints
      and constructive criticism, wild animals roaming the streets, and the general
      atmosphere in our different locations. From a tech point of view, we touch on
      IoT development, various GitHub projects to get involved with, why students
      aren’t learning how to program properly anymore, and a lot more. Get it all

  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>Welcome back to part two of our betweenisode! Everybody
    is working remotely now including ourselves, so today we continue the catch ups
    we were having with a number of longstanding buddies and chat about life after
    social distancing! The show is a back-to-back of four different conversations,
    the first being with Amos King, Chris Keathley, and Anna Neyzberg from Elixir
    Outlaws. After that we talk to Paul Schoenfelder, before getting on the line with
    Sophie DeBenedetto and Meryl Dakin. Last but not least we catch up with Dave Thomas.
    Our four conversations cover the same broad themes, and we mostly share our thoughts
    about what is happening in the world right now, how we are coping with working
    remotely, and what particular projects have been keeping us busy. Our guests share
    varying perspectives about what it means that we are restructuring the way we
    do things. We talk about how even if you worked remotely before, things feel different
    now, and we also consider the extra burdens of being a remote software developer.
    Other topics include the line between complaints and constructive criticism, wild
    animals roaming the streets, and the general atmosphere in our different locations.
    From a tech point of view, we touch on IoT development, various GitHub projects
    to get involved with, why students aren’t learning how to program properly anymore,
    and a lot more. Get it all here and make sure you stay tuned for episode one of

  description: "The world has changed so much since the end of season 3, that we thought
    we’d put together a special Betweenisode to tide you over until Season 4 launches.
    In this episode, we talk to several friends and respected members of the Elixir
    community, about how they’re coping and tips they have for retaining some normalcy
    in your life if you’re suddenly having to work from home. Our first guest, Saša
    Jurić, of Very Big Things, and author of the unrivaled Elixir in Action, has had
    the privilege of working from home for several years. He shares the importance
    of having a routine, connecting with people, and why you should get out of your
    pajamas and into some real clothes when you work. He also shares what it’s been
    like in his home city of Zagreb, and how previous devastating events have in some
    way prepared him for what’s currently happening. Bruce and Maggie Tate of Groxio,
    an educational platform to learn languages, also join us. Maggie shares more on
    her culinary adventures, and the importance of having a definite start and finish
    time to your day. Bruce talks about some of the professional projects he’s working
    on, and why he believes it’s crucial to tackle difficult technical skills outside
    of developing. Other guests include James Edward Gray II, who shares more about
    the incredible way he and his daughter have been bonding, Jim Freeze, founder
    of ElixirConf, and his son Chris, who share some of the benefits of working from
    home, and show us how to see the silver lining during this difficult time, and
    Frank Hunleth, of Nerves Project, who talks about what he’s up to. There have
    certainly been more changes in the world than we could have anticipated, so it
    was wonderful to catch up and see how people in our community have been coping.

      for retaining some normalcy in your life if you’re suddenly having to work from
      home. Our first guest, Saša Jurić, of Very Big Things, and author of the unrivaled
      Elixir in Action, has had the privilege of working from home for several years.
      He shares the importance of having a routine, connecting with people, and why
      you should get out of your pajamas and into some real clothes when you work.
      He also shares what it’s been like in his home city of Zagreb, and how previous
      devastating events have in some way prepared him for what’s currently happening.
      Bruce and Maggie Tate of Groxio, an educational platform to learn languages,
      also join us. Maggie shares more on her culinary adventures, and the importance
      of having a definite start and finish time to your day. Bruce talks about some
      of the professional projects he’s working on, and why he believes it’s crucial
      to tackle difficult technical skills outside of developing. Other guests include
      James Edward Gray II, who shares more about the incredible way he and his daughter
      have been bonding, Jim Freeze, founder of ElixirConf, and his son Chris, who
      share some of the benefits of working from home, and show us how to see the
      silver lining during this difficult time, and Frank Hunleth, of Nerves Project,
      who talks about what he’s up to. There have certainly been more changes in the

  description: "Saša Jurić is a household name in the Elixir and Erlang space and
    we are so glad to finally welcome him on to the show today! Author of Elixir in
    Action, Saša is here to discuss training and his thoughts on getting a team up
    to speed with regards to testing and beyond. We hear from our guest about his
    discovery of Elixir, his uncharacteristic early adoption of the language, and
    why he chose it. From there, Saša talks a bit about his book, the opportunity
    that arose for him to write it after Manning approached him and how he views its
    place among other prominent pieces of literature on the subject. We discuss early
    steps in the process of learning Elixir for new programmers and old, and Saša
    weighs in on when it might be a good idea to put in the effort. We also get to
    hear about very big things, where Saša works and the central work and services
    of the agency. The last part of our conversation is spent on more technical aspects
    of Saša's work, his approach to coding in general and then approaches to testing
    and the training side of this. Join us today for this great conversation!\nKey
    Points From This Episode:\nSaša's discovery of Elixir and his first experiences
    of the language.\nA lucky opportunity to write a book that presented itself to
    Saša!\nThe complementary nature of Elixir in Action; reading it in conjunction
    with other books.   \nIdeas on how to introduce the concepts of Elixir to new
    programmers and the unfamiliar. \nThe effort needed in order to understand and
    adopt the new paradigm of Elixir.\nSaša's work at very big things and the services
    that the agency offers.\nThe most useful idioms that Saša uses and the modes
    of operation at that agency. \nSaša's use of Dialyzer for debugging despite its
    imperfections.\nThe exploratory nature of good coding and finding solutions as
    you go. \nHelper libraries and comparing functions from Saša's own one!\nTraining
    for unit, feature and integration testing; Saša's approach for his team.\nDifferentiating
    between the different types of testing and the importance of naming. \nClarifying
    Saša's philosophy on testing and his understanding of the term 'unit'. \nLinks

    summary: "\n        <p>Saša Jurić is a household name in the Elixir and Erlang
      space and we are so glad to finally welcome him on to the show today! Author
      of Elixir in Action, Saša is here to discuss training and his thoughts on getting
      a team up to speed with regards to testing and beyond. We hear from our guest
      about his discovery of Elixir, his uncharacteristic early adoption of the language,
      and why he chose it. From there, Saša talks a bit about his book, the opportunity
      that arose for him to write it after Manning approached him and how he views
      its place among other prominent pieces of literature on the subject. We discuss
      early steps in the process of learning Elixir for new programmers and old, and
      Saša weighs in on when it might be a good idea to put in the effort. We also
      get to hear about very big things, where Saša works and the central work and
      services of the agency. The last part of our conversation is spent on more technical
      aspects of Saša&#39;s work, his approach to coding in general and then approaches

  description: "Our guest today, Devon Estes, approached us about the possible opportunity
    for Elixir to optimize and build out the pandas data analysis and manipulation
    tool, sharing why he thinks it would be a valuable addition to the Elixir open
    source ecosystem. But Devon joins us to contribute to our ongoing discussion about
    performance and training in the Elixir world, sharing about his current work on
    the beta for Sketch Cloud, his previous Erlang consultancy role at one of the
    largest banks in Europe, and the massive responsibility he carried while working
    on the bottom line application. He continues to advise listeners on the considerations
    for optimizing Erlang performance and solving database-specific problems, and
    the memory constraints he comes up against in the Sketch Cloud application. Devon
    talks about Benchee, a benchmarking library created by his friend, and how the
    two of them have continued to develop this tool, including its performance testing
    capabilities and how they deconstructed the benchmarking steps to build out the
    library. He also talks more broadly about the importance of considering the data
    when distinguishing between facts and opinions in conversations about performance.
    \nKey Points From This Episode:\nWhat Devon believes would be a valuable addition
    to the Elixir open source ecosystem. \nWhy optimizing and building out the pandas
    tool will be worth a company’s time and effort.\nDevon’s experience with pandas
    and Python, and recognizing the opportunity for Elixir. \nWorking on the beta
    for Sketch’s Cloud that will allow real-time collaboration. \nDevon’s consultancy
    role at Klarna, one of the largest banks in Europe. \nThe responsibility involved
    in working on the bottom-of-the-stack application at Klarna.  \nConsiderations
    for optimizing Erlang performance and why you should look at the tail. \nSolving
    the database performance problems – running queries and searches – at Klarna.
    \nThe unique memory constraints of Sketch Cloud and the problem with receiving
    large files. \nMore about Benchee, a benchmarking library, and all its performance
    testing capabilities. \nDeciding whether a function is responsible for other things
    when benchmarking. \nThe time Devon spends on optimizing performance and the first
    two steps in the process. \nThe profiling process of determining which function
    is slow and writing a benchmark for it. \nDistinguish between a fact and an opinion
    by considering the data (or lack thereof). \nKeeping in mind that truth is time-bound,
    and it also applies to benchmarking.\nDeconstructing the steps in the process
    of further developing Benchee.\nHow Devon became a maintainer of the Elixir track
    for Exercism, and what the role involves. \nLinks Mentioned in Today’s Episode:\nDevon

      Guest: Devon Estes.</p>\n      "
  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>Our guest today, Devon Estes, approached us about
    the possible opportunity for Elixir to optimize and build out the pandas data
    analysis and manipulation tool, sharing why he thinks it would be a valuable addition
    to the Elixir open source ecosystem. But Devon joins us to contribute to our ongoing
    discussion about performance and training in the Elixir world, sharing about his
    current work on the beta for Sketch Cloud, his previous Erlang consultancy role
    at one of the largest banks in Europe, and the massive responsibility he carried
    while working on the bottom line application. He continues to advise listeners
    on the considerations for optimizing Erlang performance and solving database-specific
    problems, and the memory constraints he comes up against in the Sketch Cloud application.
    Devon talks about Benchee, a benchmarking library created by his friend, and how
    the two of them have continued to develop this tool, including its performance
    testing capabilities and how they deconstructed the benchmarking steps to build
    out the library. He also talks more broadly about the importance of considering
    the data when distinguishing between facts and opinions in conversations about
    performance. </p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What Devon
    believes would be a valuable addition to the Elixir open source ecosystem. </li>\n<li>Why
    optimizing and building out the pandas tool will be worth a company’s time and
    effort.</li>\n<li>Devon’s experience with pandas and Python, and recognizing the
    opportunity for Elixir. </li>\n<li>Working on the beta for Sketch’s Cloud that
    will allow real-time collaboration. </li>\n<li>Devon’s consultancy role at Klarna,
    one of the largest banks in Europe. </li>\n<li>The responsibility involved in
    working on the bottom-of-the-stack application at Klarna.<br></li>\n<li>Considerations
    for optimizing Erlang performance and why you should look at the tail. </li>\n<li>Solving
    the database performance problems – running queries and searches – at Klarna.
    </li>\n<li>The unique memory constraints of Sketch Cloud and the problem with
    receiving large files. </li>\n<li>More about Benchee, a benchmarking library,
    and all its performance testing capabilities. </li>\n<li>Deciding whether a function
    is responsible for other things when benchmarking. </li>\n<li>The time Devon spends
    on optimizing performance and the first two steps in the process. </li>\n<li>The
    profiling process of determining which function is slow and writing a benchmark
    for it. </li>\n<li>Distinguish between a fact and an opinion by considering the
    data (or lack thereof). </li>\n<li>Keeping in mind that truth is time-bound, and
    it also applies to benchmarking.</li>\n<li>Deconstructing the steps in the process
    of further developing Benchee.</li>\n<li>How Devon became a maintainer of the
    Elixir track for Exercism, and what the role involves. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Links

  description: "This week we're delighted to share a special format bonus episode!
    \nWe are joined by guest co-host Todd Resudek as well as a number of guests who
    each share a little bit about what they're working on and in many cases their
    upcoming presentations at Lonestar Elixir. \nSpecial episode guests: \n* Angel
    Jose, Senior Platform Engineer at Cars.com\n* Dave Lucia, VP of Engineering at
    SimpleBet\n* Greg Mefford, Senior Back-End Engineer at Bleacher Report\n* Melvin
    Cedeno, Elixir Developer at SplitGyms\n* Zach Thomas, API Developer at Blinker\nMost
    of our guests weigh in about their upcoming presentations at the event and we
    also get to chat about a few near and dear topics with our rotating cast. We hear
    about where they are working, their experiences with Elixir and their thoughts
    on education and company culture. It's an unusual episode but one we are so glad
    to have had the chance to make! We also find time to touch on our focus for the
    next season of the podcast, which is very exciting for all of us over here at
    the show. Remember to stay plugged in for more on Lonestar Elixir and attend if
    you can!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nSome thoughts on LiveView and its adoption
    by new developers. \nAngel's work at Cars and how they are using Elixir and LiveView
    to rewrite everything.\nChatbots and the immediate benefits of using Elixir to
    rewrite them.\nThe elevator pitch on SimpleBet and the tech stack, skillset and
    ecosystem of the company.\nWhy Dave and his team have moved away from Rust! \nA
    quick tease of what to expect for Season 4 of the podcast: Architecture of Applications!
    \ \nHow Bleacher Report is using Elixir to build the 'third space' for sports
    fans.\nTeam building and expansion at Bleacher Report and the stages of scaling.
    \ \nA sneak preview of Greg's upcoming talk at Lonestar!\nHow Greg got started
    with Nerves and why it has a special place in his heart.  \nThe theme of Melvin's
    talk at Lonestar; untraditional routes and emotions in tech. \nConsidering the
    usefulness of boot camps, the value of ISAs and CS programs.\nZach's background
    in Elixir and his current work at Blinker with the language.\nExperiences at Turing
    and in liberal arts during college.\nZach's Lonestar talk elevator pitch: 'Getting
    the Frog out of the Well'. \nThe allegory of the cave, 'what is water' and how
    this differs from Zach's idea. \nWhy don't we like statically typed things as
    much as we should?\nLinks Mentioned in Today’s Episode:\nSmartLogic — https://smartlogic.io/

  description: "In line with our current working-with-Elixir theme, today we’re talking
    about performance with Paul Schoenfelder and Hans Elias Josephsen from DockYard.
    The two have been working on Lumen, and in this episode, they discuss how this
    project is incorporated with WebAssembly, a binary instruction format that ultimately
    allows Elixir to be run in the browser and preserve the semantics of the language.
    Paul and Hans talk about the specific aspects of Lumen they are working on; the
    data flow and process of writing Elixir; and the compiler, interpreter and run-time
    functions involved. Joining in this conversation, you will also hear how they
    approached starting developing Lumen as a brand new compiler, researching, the
    aspects Paul wanted to tackle first, and when users can expect Lumen to be released.
    We also talk about the performance concerns they encountered along the way, the
    many reasons why Rust was their programming language of choice, and their thoughts
    on generic associated types in Rust. \nKey Points From This Episode:\n• How Paul
    and Hans got introduced to Elixir and working for DockYard.\n• An overview of
    what Lumen is and how it relates to WebAssembly. \n• WebAssembly code to run Elixir
    in the browser and preserve the semantics of the language. \n• The different aspects
    of the Lumen project that Paul and Hans are involved in. \n• The data flow and
    process when writing Elixir and how the compiler function features.\n• Taking
    advantage of optimizations that can be performed on the code that is generated.
    \n• An explanation of the interpreter and run-time parts of the project. \n• How
    they approached the major task of starting with a brand new compiler. \n• The

    subtitle: Paul Schoenfelder and Hans Elias Josephsen from DockYard have been working
      on Lumen, and in this episode, we discuss how this project is incorporated with
      WebAssembly, a binary instruction format that ultimately allows Elixir to be
      run in the browser and preserve the semantics of the language. We talk specifics
      - the data flow and process of writing Elixir, the compiler, interpreter, and
      run-time functions involved, Rust as the programming language of choice, and
      when users can expect Lumen to be released.

    summary: "\n        <p>In line with our current working-with-Elixir theme, today
      we’re talking about performance with Paul Schoenfelder and Hans Elias Josephsen
      from DockYard. The two have been working on Lumen, and in this episode, they
      discuss how this project is incorporated with WebAssembly, a binary instruction
      format that ultimately allows Elixir to be run in the browser and preserve the
      semantics of the language. Paul and Hans talk about the specific aspects of
      Lumen they are working on; the data flow and process of writing Elixir; and
      the compiler, interpreter and run-time functions involved. Joining in this conversation,
      you will also hear how they approached starting developing Lumen as a brand
      new compiler, researching, the aspects Paul wanted to tackle first, and when
      users can expect Lumen to be released. We also talk about the performance concerns
      they encountered along the way, the many reasons why Rust was their programming
      language of choice, and their thoughts on generic associated types in Rust.
      </p>\n\n<p>Key Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<p>• How Paul and Hans got introduced
      to Elixir and working for DockYard.<br>\n• An overview of what Lumen is and
      how it relates to WebAssembly. <br>\n• WebAssembly code to run Elixir in the
      browser and preserve the semantics of the language. <br>\n• The different aspects
      of the Lumen project that Paul and Hans are involved in. <br>\n• The data flow
      and process when writing Elixir and how the compiler function features.<br>\n•
      Taking advantage of optimizations that can be performed on the code that is
      generated. <br>\n• An explanation of the interpreter and run-time parts of the
      project. <br>\n• How they approached the major task of starting with a brand
      new compiler. <br>\n• The process of researching and why Paul wanted to get

  description: "Today on the show we are joined by Sophie DeBenedetto from GitHub
    and Meryl Dakin from Frame.io to talk about the processes involved in training
    others and building Elixir projects. They share about studying and working together
    at the Flatiron School and what they do now in their respective new roles at Github
    and Frame.io. During their time at Flatiron, they worked on various projects,
    often collaborating with engineering teams from other companies and having to
    train these team members in Elixir. They talk about how they managed to develop
    new features while simultaneously onboarding new people and getting everyone on
    the same page. For them, the pair programming model had been most beneficial,
    and they discuss the habits and practices they implemented to encourage team members,
    optimize each learning experience, and share knowledge during training events.
    Sophie and Meryl also share the Elixir-specific challenges they encountered while
    developing applications for 2U, how Elixir’s failure-first programming capability
    guided them, how they prepare for training workshops, and the productivity hacks
    that keep them focused and energized. \nKey Points From This Episode:\n• How Sophie
    and Meryl know each other from working and studying at the Flatiron School. \n•
    Frame.io as a tool that facilitates the communication between video editors and
    clients. \n• Meryl’s new role as a full-stack developer working with Elixir and
    React. \n• The projects they worked on at Flatiron and partnering with various
    companies like 2U. \n• Their secret to developing new features while also introducing
    new team members to Elixir.  \n• The benefits of pair programming and teaching
    a programming language to others. \n• Reserving time to celebrate wins and knowledge
    share during training events. \n• Key lessons they learned from their collaboration
    with the 2U team. \n• Elixir-specific challenges during the development of the
    applications project with 2U. \n• How Elixir’s failure-first programming capability
    ultimately helps developers. \n• Sophie and Meryl’s experience using LiveView
    at Flatiron and the problems encountered. \n• The work that went into preparing
    for training workshops. \n• Advice for teaching someone who is not technical to
    become a working developer.\n• Productivity hacks to stay focused and regain energy.

  description: "In today’s episode we have one of our favorite recurring guests, Brooklyn
    Zelenka, joining us once again! Brooklyn has been on the show in both the first
    and second seasons to speak about Elixir and functional programming. In those
    conversations, it came up that this topic is far from exhausted, and since Season
    3's theme is working with Elixir, we thought it would be great to have Brooklyn
    on for a third time. Today, Brooklyn does not speak to Elixir specifically though,
    but on functional programming more broadly. Fission, her company which is working
    on developing next-generation hostless apps, actually uses Haskel, but Brooklyn
    has a ton of experience across the board. She gives us some great insights into
    what makes the functional versus OOP paradigm great and helps us to understand
    some of the inner workings of both worlds, talking about abstraction, application,
    data orientation, and more. Interestingly, Brooklyn does employ some imperative
    programming in her company through the use of Typescript, but uses a functional
    style to get around the context switch. We spend some time toward the end of the
    show digging deeper into macros, and Brooklyn helps to revise understandings of
    them as code which writes more code as well as clarifies the term 'homoiconic'
    as it relates to ASTs. Brooklyn covers a whole lot more today so hop on for a
    deep dive into functional programming with today's great guest.\nKey Points From
    This Episode:\n• Why Brooklyn uses FPE: it can be reused and reasoned about.\n•
    Two things that functions provide: abstraction and application.\n• Data orientation
    and hiding information: imperative vs functional paradigms.\n• Understanding imperative
    programming: it’s less structured and hard to reason about.\n• Challenges experienced
    imperative programmers face with functional programming.\n• Differences between
    Elixir, Erlang, Haskel, Elm, and Clojure.\n• Using Clojure: tradeoffs, distinctions,
    tooling, flexibility, and compatibility with Java.\n• The language Brooklyn could
    use if only one existed: Racket.\n• Bridging functional and imperative paradigms
    through disciplined use of style.\n• Segfaults in Haskell related to its compatibility
    with lib C.\n• How to use Musl instead of lib C by employing docker files.\n•
    Algebraic types and why static types aren’t hindrances in functional languages.\n•
    Preferences for tests or proofs and their role in finding types valuable.\n• Macros
    as compile-time functions that are difficult to debug.\n• A definition of a ‘homoiconic’:
    high-level syntax which represents the AST.\n• What makes C macros different from
    Lisp ones.\n• Architecture in Elixir and the need for a more user-friendly Haskell.\nLinks

    subtitle: In today’s episode we have one of our favorite recurring guests, Brooklyn
      Zelenka, joining us once again! Brooklyn has been on the show in both the first
      and second seasons to speak about Elixir and functional programming. In those
      conversations, it came up that this topic is far from exhausted, and since Season
      3's theme is working with Elixir, we thought it would be great to have Brooklyn
      on for a third time. Today, Brooklyn does not speak to Elixir specifically though,
      but on functional programming more broadly.

  description: "Groxio is a great platform that allows programmers to learn new languages
    easily and broaden their horizons. Our guests today are the team behind Groxio,
    Bruce and Maggie Tate! In our discussion, we cover the basics and the not so basics
    of what they do, from how they got into the Elixir world and founded Groxio to
    the conferences they run and the books they have published. We also talk about
    the benefits of learning multiple languages and Bruce makes a strong argument
    for the influence that smaller coding languages have had on his Elixir skills.
    Maggie and Bruce open up about having a professional and personal partnership
    and how they manage their marriage and businesses side by side. To finish off
    we hear about all the exciting things to expect at the Lonestar Conference this
    year and how it is going to be even better than last year's!\nKey Points From
    This Episode:\n• Bruce and Maggie's background in Elixir and how they started
    Groxio. \n• What sets Groxio apart from similar technical education companies.
    \ \n• The inspiration that Bruce got from the Crystal and Pony languages.\n• How
    curiosity and dopamine are linked; following new and interesting pathways. \n•
    Maggie and Bruce's personal and professional partnership and how they manage it.
    \n• The Elixir books that still need to be written and under-appreciated published
    ones.\n• A guide to Bruce's books and which to read for particular applications.
    \n• Running a conference; the stressful and fun parts for Maggie and Bruce.\n•
    Aspirations for the conferences and what to expect at this year's events. \n•
    Exciting speakers that will be appearing at the Lone Star Conference. \n• The

    a guest and cohost a few times on the show. Today we are talking about hiring
    and training and his experience with these tasks at the company and especially
    concerning Elixir. We discuss the challenges Dan has faced in recruiting and the

  description: "We are happy to be joined in this episode by Eric Meadows Jönsson,
    creator of the hexpm package manager, and an amazing resource who works tirelessly
    to build the Elixir community. Eric presently works at Brex and was part of the
    core team at Forza previously. In keeping with our current topic of all things
    working with Elixir, Eric takes a deep dive into the work he is doing to optimize
    various interfaces at Brex. He gives us the rundown on the static compile-time
    checking project he is working on, talking about his aims to build in different
    warnings and what we can expect from the new release in that regard. You’ll also
    hear about Eric’s journey learning Elixir and how he had to change his OOP mindset
    when he got introduced to functional programming at university. He shares the
    story behind hexpm and Mint, his thoughts about the future of Hex, and some of
    the processes around accessing the private repositories on its website. We also
    hear more about Eric’s hiring procedure while working at Forza, how he teaches
    functional programming to students at ElixirConf, and some of the major performance
    bottlenecks he experiences using Hex. Tap into the incredible resource that is
    Eric and hear more about how you can link with him online to learn further in
    the future by tuning in!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nJose Valim, the Ecto
    library, and Eric’s journey with Elixir since 2012 at a coding camp.\nEarly-stage
    static compile-time checks that Eric is adding to the compiler at Brex.\nWhether
    the static compile-time checks Eric is adding constitute a type system or not.\nStatic
    compile-time checks in the current system such as undefined function warnings.\nFeatures
    of the new static compile-time check release: refactored checks, etc.\nCurrently,
    these checks happen at compile-time, or when Elixir compiles into the byte code.\nWhether
    these checks will move into BEAM: currently it’s in Elixir and at an early stage.\nThe
    Erlang compiler already does type inference during compilation. \nEric’s Erlang
    proficiency and why he had to brush up on it through using Elixir.\nWhat makes
    Eric helpful with Hex: his debugging skills and availability to answer questions.\nHow
    Eric got started with Hex adding an intake for Git packages.\nThe story behind
    Hex regarding ties to Elixir and Devinus from Pool Boy.\nTodd’s perspective on
    Eric as a smart and nice mentor who sleeps very little.\nChanges that Eric sees
    happening in Elixir.\nHex will no longer support older Elixir versions so that
    it can enable better maintenance.\nAnother change will be a refactoring of the
    resolution version algorithm.\nSecurity-related updates that Todd has been working
    on.\nPrivate versus public repositories on the hex.pm website.\nHiring challenges
    at Forza and how Eric found the right team out of scarce people.\nEric looks for
    people who love being programmers and have a passion for learning.\nTactics Eric
    uses to train functional programming such as hosting ElixirConf workshops.\nImportant
    fundamentals in functional programming: using data structures to model data, etc.\nDifferences
    between functional and object-oriented programming: data vs classes.\nThe role
    of types in Eric coming to understand functional programming better.\nPerformance
    bottlenecks in Hex such as dependency resolution.\nHow every package manager/resolver
    compromises, exemplified by NPM and Rebar3.\nOrigins of Mint: wanting http2 support
    for Hex, and more.\nLinks Mentioned in Today’s Episode:\nSmartLogic — https://smartlogic.io/

    on its website. We also hear more about Eric’s hiring procedure while working
    at Forza, how he teaches functional programming to students at ElixirConf, and
    some of the major performance bottlenecks he experiences using Hex. Tap into the
    incredible resource that is Eric and hear more about how you can link with him
    online to learn further in the future by tuning in!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Points
    From This Episode:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jose Valim, the Ecto library, and
    Eric’s journey with Elixir since 2012 at a coding camp.</li>\n<li>Early-stage
    static compile-time checks that Eric is adding to the compiler at Brex.</li>\n<li>Whether
    the static compile-time checks Eric is adding constitute a type system or not.</li>\n<li>Static
    compile-time checks in the current system such as undefined function warnings.</li>\n<li>Features
    of the new static compile-time check release: refactored checks, etc.</li>\n<li>Currently,
    these checks happen at compile-time, or when Elixir compiles into the byte code.</li>\n<li>Whether
    these checks will move into BEAM: currently it’s in Elixir and at an early stage.</li>\n<li>The
    Erlang compiler already does type inference during compilation. </li>\n<li>Eric’s
    Erlang proficiency and why he had to brush up on it through using Elixir.</li>\n<li>What
    makes Eric helpful with Hex: his debugging skills and availability to answer questions.</li>\n<li>How
    Eric got started with Hex adding an intake for Git packages.</li>\n<li>The story
    behind Hex regarding ties to Elixir and Devinus from Pool Boy.</li>\n<li>Todd’s
    perspective on Eric as a smart and nice mentor who sleeps very little.</li>\n<li>Changes
    that Eric sees happening in Elixir.</li>\n<li>Hex will no longer support older
    Elixir versions so that it can enable better maintenance.</li>\n<li>Another change
    will be a refactoring of the resolution version algorithm.</li>\n<li>Security-related
    updates that Todd has been working on.</li>\n<li>Private versus public repositories
    on the hex.pm website.</li>\n<li>Hiring challenges at Forza and how Eric found
    the right team out of scarce people.</li>\n<li>Eric looks for people who love
    being programmers and have a passion for learning.</li>\n<li>Tactics Eric uses
    to train functional programming such as hosting ElixirConf workshops.</li>\n<li>Important
    fundamentals in functional programming: using data structures to model data, etc.</li>\n<li>Differences
    between functional and object-oriented programming: data vs classes.</li>\n<li>The
    role of types in Eric coming to understand functional programming better.</li>\n<li>Performance
    bottlenecks in Hex such as dependency resolution.</li>\n<li>How every package
    manager/resolver compromises, exemplified by NPM and Rebar3.</li>\n<li>Origins
    of Mint: wanting http2 support for Hex, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Links

  description: "Our guest on the show today is blogger, software cowboy, and podcast
    host Chris Keathley. Chris is a senior engineer at Bleacher Report, co-host of
    Elixir Outlaws, and writer of an assemblage of open-source software. He joins
    us today to speak about his new projects, his journey with functional programming,
    and what it is like to run Bleacher Report’s infrastructure on Elixir. Chris gives
    us the lowdown on Norm, a data validating interface he recently completed, weighing
    in on how it is different from Dialyzer and what it can offer as far as scalability.
    We hear more about how Chris got introduced to Elixir through Haskell, why he
    wishes he learned Clojure sooner, and why Ruby on Rails isn’t going anywhere soon.
    \nChris also gets into the tradeoffs these languages make to correlate with Erlang.
    He argues that Elixir can only be more widely adopted if more people build cool
    things in it, and then lays out some of its power in supporting Bleacher Report’s
    user interface. We pick Chris’s brain about what his company is trying to optimize
    at the moment and hear about their preference for capacity over speed, and their
    techniques for failing gracefully during traffic spikes. Chris tells us how much
    he loves Elixir due to its use of ETS and other functionality which allows Bleacher
    Report to keep running even above capacity. Finally, we hear about some of the
    observability practices that Bleacher Report uses when deploying new systems and
    predicting future spikes. Plug in for a great conversation and hear why you should
    get building with Elixir now!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nChris’s explanation
    of Norm, his new software that describes data moving through a system.\nChris’s
    introduction to functional programming through learning Haskell, Clojure, and
    Elixir.\nWhat makes a great functional language: immutable data and first class
    functions.\nThings that make Clojure great, such as its thought out, holistic
    design.\nCharacteristics of Cons lists versus RRB trees, and what makes the latter
    better.\nAn acknowledgment of the necessity of the tradeoffs Elixir makes to interact
    with Erlang.\nA little bit about the language Chris wrote to do the admin of code
    challenges in.\nWhy Ruby (on Rails) will not be replaced by Elixir due to commoditization
    that surrounds it.\nAn argument that Elixir can only be more widely adopted if
    more people build with it.\nWhy any language can build any program thus comparisons
    between them are arbitrary.\nWhere Chris sets the bar as to when something is
    performant.\nChris’s preference for high user capacity capability over speed of
    delivery at Bleacher Report.\nOptimization projects at Bleacher Report such as
    using few boxes and handling traffic spikes.\nThings Chris loves about Elixir
    such as its ability to deliver more from its boxes.\nElixir’s use of ETS and how

  description: "On today’s show, we welcome Justin Schneck and Frank Hunleth, luminaries
    from the Nerves team! We take a dive into the world of Nerves with them, covering
    themes of performance, problem-solving, transitioning to hardware, and breakthroughs
    in the field. We begin with a conversation on how Elixir handles performance issues
    on the range of devices they support and Frank gets into how the team solved an
    early boot time discrepancy between a PC and a Raspberry Pi board. Other big themes
    for today are ironing out the kinks in the system registry model and merging Erlang
    and into hard real-time. After squeezing some information out of the guys about
    their use of ugly code hacks we get into some visionary decisions as well as things
    the team wished they could have done differently at Elixir (see the release of
    the new networking stack). Finally, we end off with what Frank and Justin are
    excited about as far as developments in the Nerves community, so be sure to plug
    into this one!\n**Key Points From This Episode:\nWhat Justin did in Tokyo, from
    soaking in hot springs to debugging in Kanji.\nAn explanation of The Erlang Ecosystem
    Foundation, an embedded systems working group.\nThe use of the VintageNet library
    for setting up multi-hold nerve networks.\nHow Elixir handles performance issues
    on the range of devices they support.\nA breakdown of troubleshooting processes
    as far as acceleration with FPGAs.\nIssues with dependencies that occur when starting
    a network node on a Nerves device.\nHow Elixir is trying to evolve past the system
    registry model.\nIdentifying the challenge of reconfiguring early boot time which
    Elixir is facing.\nHow Elixir solved a load time discrepancy between a PC and

    subtitle: On today’s show, we welcome Justin Schneck and Frank Hunleth, luminaries
      from the Nerves team! We take a dive into the world of Nerves with them, covering
      themes of performance, problem-solving, transitioning to hardware, and breakthroughs
      in the field. We begin with a conversation on how Elixir handles performance
      issues on the range of devices they support and Frank gets into how the team
      solved an early boot time discrepancy between a PC and a Raspberry Pi board.
      Other big themes for today are ironing out the kinks in the system registry
      model and merging Erlang and into hard real-time. After squeezing some information
      out of the guys about their use of ugly code hacks we get into some visionary
      decisions as well as things the team wished they could have done differently
      at Elixir (see the release of the new networking stack). Finally, we end off
      with what Frank and Justin are excited about as far as developments in the Nerves
      community, so be sure to plug into this one!

    today is Brad Traylor from Podium. Brad shares his expertise in hiring and training
    for Podium, a position he is passionate about since it gives him the opportunity

    background, when and how he was first introduced to Elixir and the standout qualities
    that attracted him to Podium. He discusses the hiring process, including what
    he looks for in an engineer, why they don’t recruit much but rather work with

  description: "Today on Elixir Wizards we are joined by none other than José Valim,
    the inventor of Elixir! Coming from the Ruby on Rails world, José found his way
    to functional programming and we hear all about the evolution of his philosophy
    and thought process around the time of the creation of the language. He gives
    us some great insight into why functional programming is so appealing to him and
    the problems he wanted to solve by creating Elixir. We chat about other languages
    and his use of Erlang, Elixir's three biggest influences and some important characters
    in the story. José also shares a bit of personal, behind the scenes stuff about
    his schedule and how he tries to stay as productive as possible. We finish off
    the chat, talking about performance and the measures José has taken in this regard.
    For all this and more from a true Elixir wizard, be sure to tune in!\nKey Points
    From This Episode:\nJosé's thoughts on our recent podcast name-change!\nThe first
    steps for José in the process of writing a language.\nReason for José's decision
    to step out of the Ruby on Rails world. \nThe 'aha' moment that José had when
    moving into functional programming. \nSome of the inspiration for Elixir from
    other languages.\nA few of the people that have mentored and inspired José in
    his career. \nThe research and development phase for Elixir and José strategy
    for this. \nJosé's work habits, his typical day and the influence of his kids
    on his flow. \nWhy José still considers himself an Elixir programmer despite his
    proximity. \nElixir and machine learning; why the two are not more closely linked.
    \nSteps in the measurement process for José and Elixir. \nThe time that José has
    spent on the performance side of the language. \nSacrifices and substitution in
    optimizing Elixir's performance. \nSome of the things on the horizon that are

    subtitle: Today on Elixir Wizards we are joined by none other than José Valim,
      the inventor of Elixir! Coming from the Ruby on Rails world, José found his
      way to functional programming and we hear all about the evolution of his philosophy
      and thought process around the time of the creation of the language. He gives
      us some great insight into why functional programming is so appealing to him
      and the problems he wanted to solve by creating Elixir. We chat about other
      languages and his use of Erlang, Elixir's three biggest influences and some
      important characters in the story. José also shares a bit of personal, behind
      the scenes stuff about his schedule and how he tries to stay as productive as
      possible. We finish off the chat, talking about performance and the measures
      José has taken in this regard. For all this and more from a true Elixir wizard,
      be sure to tune in!

    We are taking this opportunity to recap what we covered in the season and talk
    about what we liked and what we didn&#39;t like so much. We do not have a guest
    for today&#39;s show so it is just Eric and Justus doing some reflection. We do
    want to take this opportunity to thank all of our guests that have appeared on
    this season and shared their expertise with us, we definitely feel we learned
    a lot during this time! In Season 3 we will be focussing on functional programming,
    performance and teaching Elixir, so make sure to keep an eye out for when that
    drops in the future!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Points From This Episode:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The
    possibility of longer episodes for next season </li>\n<li>Reflections on ElixirConf
    and the time we spent there this year. </li>\n<li>The upcoming conference in New

    President of Engineering at SimpleBet. He is here as part of Elixir Internals
    series, to talk to us and all our listeners about Rustler and the contribution
    he made to the library! According to our guest, Rustler acts as a bridge between
    Rust and Elixir and allows users to employ the power of Rust within Elixir and
    a great example of this can be found in Dave's work at SimpleBet. He explains
    some of this application and the functionality and improvement it offers and the
    big difference the machine learning models make to this work. Dave also gives
    us some background to his work and career, previous employment and early explorations
    of open-source software. He also shares some great tips for problem-solving and
    learning and improving at programming in Rust. We unpack some of the biggest challenges
    that faced the creation of Rustler, notable differences between Rust and Elixir
    and the technical components of the library that the team created. For all this
    and then some, join us for this great episode!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nMore
    about our guest and his current work at SimpleBet. \nHow Dave got started with

  description: "Welcome to another episode of the podcast everybody! As we continue
    our journey into Elixir internals in Season 2, we welcome Sophie DeBenedetto to
    tell us about the two libraries she and the Flatiron School created! We talk about
    Encrypt and Railway and a bunch of other great stuff from the world of Elixir
    and open source and Sophie shares so much about why she is particularly excited
    about things at the moment. She talks about the maturation of the Elixir community
    and her first and most important open-source experiences before diving into her
    hopes for the future of these platforms. We also discuss the ins and out of the
    two libraries and our guest does a fantastic job of explaining their functions
    and the reasons they were built. Sophie shares the major challenges that faced
    her and the team in creating them and a whole lot more, so make sure to tune in
    today for all this great information!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nA brief
    introduction to Sophie's career, the Flatiron School and her Elixir work.\nSophie's
    first experiences with open source, contributing to the Elixir School. \nFlatiron's
    support of open source and their attitude towards the growth of engineers. \nWhy
    Elixir and Ruby are such important languages to Sophie and Flatiron. \nSophie's
    wishes for Elixir and what she wants to see more of in the community. \nIntroducing
    Encrypt and Excrypt for Elixir and why Flatiron chose to build them.\nThe hardest
    parts of building the library, the challenges of encryption.\nElixir's built-in
    option parser; convenience and accessing data easily.\nThe Railway hex package
    and what it enables users to do. \nBreaking down the functions of RabbitMQ for

  description: "Today on the show we are joined by Michal Muskala, who is currently
    a freelance software engineer and he is here to talk to us about his work on the

    explain how he became involved in the project and the work he did on it. He explains
    a little of its inner workings, issues and what excited him about it initially.
    We then turn to jason, a widely popular library that Michal created for parsing
    JSON. Michal unpacks its particulars, differentiating for us between the driver
    and adapter and the lessons he learned working on them. The last bit of our conversation
    is spent talking about open source and Michal's commitment to its philosophy.
    We discuss making time to work on projects, buy in from employers and and why
    getting involved can be scary yet is so important! For all this and more, join
    us for this great episode!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nA little bit about
    Michal's work background and how he got started on Elixir. \nThe parts of Ecto
    that Michal worked on at Google Summer of Code.\nDifferentiating between the driver
    and the adapter; communicating with the database.\nStructuring the code and what
    Michal would do differently now. \nCreating jason, the default JSON parser and
    the impetus behind it. \nUnderstanding lexing and tokenizing; largely the same
    thing with different names.\nMacros on jason and forcing the VM to use optimizations
    in particular cases. \nPerformance on jason; how Michal achieved the speeds he
    did.\nMichal's path to open source software and what followed his work in MongoDB.

    no signs of slowing down. In this episode, we discover what makes the Hex packages
    some of the most popular packages out there today, as well as the new and improved
    features currently in the pipeline. In addition, we find out how Todd first got
    involved with the Hex team and how the team makes decisions and problem solves.

  description: "In this episode of the podcast we are joined by Chris Keathley to
    continue our exploration of Elixir internals as he tells us about two very popular
    libraries that he developed, Wallaby and Raft. We start off with some background
    and his initial experiences with Elixir and open source projects before diving
    into Wallaby and some of the biggest lessons that Chris learned during and after
    his work on the library. \nChris does a great job of explaining concurrent tests
    and the Sandbox and some of the reasons he has pretty much stopped working on
    the front end of projects. From there we move onto another one of Chris' exciting
    projects, Raft! In order to introduce the library, Chris explains more about consensus
    algorithms, Leslie Lamport and his groundbreaking work on Paxos. Raft is, in some
    ways, a simplified, more accessible version of Paxos for Elixir and Chris goes
    on to give a brief rundown of its inner workings. For this great conversation
    with a great guest, join us today!\nKey Points From This Episode:\nChris' background,
    history with Elixir and his current employment. \nHow Chris got started with open
    source work. \nWhy Chris has moved away from front end work in the last while.
    \nThe major lessons Chris learned while building Wallaby.\nHow the concurrent
    tests work on Wallaby and the Sandbox. \nWhy Chris is still excited about Raft,
    even though he hasn't touched it in a while.  \nExplaining Raft, consensus algorithms
    and Paxos. \nHow the Raft library actually works; building Raft systems and processes.

  description: "Welcome back to the SmartLogic Podcast where we talk about the latest
    developments and best practices in the web and mobile software industry. In continuing
    with our theme of Elixir Internals, we’re having a conversation about the inner
    workings of one of the most popular Elixir libraries, Credo, and we are joined
    by the author René Föhring. \nRené shares the story of how he was introduced
    to Elixir while doing his PhD and looking for a new programming language and then
    shares the philosophy and inspiration Credo was developed on. Wanting Credo to
    be a less rule-based, authoritative code analysis tool and more user friendly,
    René focused on creating it to act as a type of digital mentor to the many developers
    out there who do not have a human mentor. He also shares about some of the launching
    hiccups, what he would have done differently had he been given another opportunity
    and some of the most important lessons that he has learned working in the open
    source community. Be sure to join us for all the inside info! \nKey Points from
    This Episode:\nMore about René’s job as head of product development at 5 Minds
    and what they do. \nWhat he does in his free time: open source maintenance and
    conference speaking. \nHow he got started with Elixir and wanting to learn a new
    programming language.\nWhat Credo is all about, why you’d want to use it and what
    makes it different.  \nThe inspiration behind writing Credo and wanting a more
    positive, less dogmatic tool.  \nStarting off building on Dogma but then pivoting
    and going in an independent direction. \nThe hiccups René experienced when first
    releasing Credo and what he’d do differently. \nThe different checks in Credo
    and how they function and respond to issues. \nHow Elixir 1.6 impacted the development
    of Credo.  \nWhat’s new with the Credo 1.1 release?\nRené’s experience working
    with open source and the first library he contributed to.  \nImportant lessons
    he has learned by being part of the open source community. \nAnd much more! \nLinks

    libraries we are talking to Paul Schoenfelder! He is here to unpack Distillery,
    his own creation from the world of Elixir and tell us about how it works. We also
    discuss how Paul made the transition from bigger corporations into the startup
    world, his early experiences of different coding languages and the initial steps
    he took in writing Distillery. Paul is very honest about the unclear future of
    the library and he shares his hopes for it for the short term as well as clarifying
    its key concepts and functions. He gives great advice and directions for learning
    more about the resource and how you can help him and his projects out if you use

    Points From This Episode: \n* Paul's work background, language history and the
    last few years working Elixir. \n* The first library that Paul contributed to
    and created on his own! \n* What brought about the creation of Distillery. \n*
    Clarifying releases, compiling, generating, deployment and more. \n* Where to
    learn more and find out details about the library. \n* The first steps Paul took
    when writing this latest version of the Distillery. \n* Looking to the future
    of Distillery and its current best use cases. \n* Hot upgrades and who they can
    be useful to when it comes to Elixir. \n* Let Paul know if you are using or want

  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>Today on the show we continue our series on the inner
    workings and various libraries of Elixir and are very happy to welcome Bryan Joseph
    of Revelry to talk about his very own ElixirScript. ElixirScript is essentially
    an Elixir to JavaScript compiler, allowing users to run Elixir online more easily.
    We ask Bryan what inspired this project and about some of the major challenges
    that have faced it. We also talk about the role of his company, Revelry in his
    career and work in open source. Bryan tells us about his very own conference,
    The Big Elixir and why you should be traveling to New Orleans to check it out!
    Other topics covered include the architecture of ElixirScript, binary pattern
    matching, Bryan&#39;s other experiences of libraries and his hopes for ElixirScript&#39;s
    future. For all this and then some, be sure to listen in today!</p>\n\n<p>Key
    Points From This Episode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Some background on Bryan, his work
    and how he got started with Elixir. </li>\n<li>What is ElixirScript? What does
    it do? How Brian got the idea!</li>\n<li>ElixirScript&#39;s architecture; the
    inner workings of the compiler.</li>\n<li>The major problems and challenges that
    face this task with JavaScript. </li>\n<li>Step one in the process; the conversion
    of concepts.</li>\n<li>Binary pattern matching and the implementation of strings.
    </li>\n<li>The things Bryan would do differently looking back on the product.<br></li>\n<li>Bryan&#39;s

  description: "Hey everybody and welcome back to Season 2 of the podcast! This season
    we will be talking about Elixir internals, libraries and the inner workings of
    the language. In our first episode we are very happy to be joined by Brooklyn
    Zelenka to start off our journey on the subject with an exploration of her very
    own Witchcraft.\nIn this episode we talk to Brooklyn about her history with Elixir,
    how she got started and what attracts her to it. Brooklyn explains the influence
    that open source philosophy has had on her career in developing and from there
    she gives a pretty comprehensive introduction to what Witchcraft is, expanding
    its key concepts. Although this is quite a high level discussion about Elixir
    and Witchcraft, we are confident that with Brooklyn's expert help even our most
    uninitiated listener can get some benefit from our conversation. We also talk
    about type systems, property-based checking and Dialyzer, so for all of this and
    more make sure to join us as we kick things off for Season 2!\nKey Points From
    This Episode:\nA quick introduction to Brooklyn, where she works and how she got
    started with Elixir.  \nThe influence of open source and library contributions
    on Brooklyn's development.\nGetting to grips with Witchcraft; defining monads
    and functors.\nWhy some of these scary terms do not need to frighten you. \nA
    few little things that differentiate Witchcraft and some surprising elements.\nThe
    convenient guarantees that Witchcraft provides around your data structure. \nWhy
    there is no type system baked into Elixir; overheads, inputs and outputs. \nProperty-based
    checking and compile times in Witchcraft.\nMerging of Elixir and Dialyzer; benefits

  description: "We talk with Jay Ashe from Cava about their current and past Elixir
    projects and how they are deployed.\nJay Ashe - Cava (https://cava.com/)\nFind
    Jay elsewhere online:\nhttps://twitter.com/jgashe\n0:40 - Give us a quick overview
    of the Elixir projects you have in production.\nCAVA is a fast-casual mediterranean
    restaurant chain with 75 stores across the US. Elixir and phoenix power CAVA’s
    online ordering platform (order.cava.com and the CAVA app). We’ve got a REST (and
    websockets) api sitting behind react and our mobile apps, and we use phoenix templates
    for some of our back of house systems.\n1:11 - Why are you using Elixir in production?\nWe
    have from the start! The application was originally implemented by Chris Bell
    and his team at madebymany. Chris, by the way, has a fantastic talk from ElixirConf
    2016 that goes into our architecture and how we use elixir and OTP constructs
    to model our business logic. Chris will occasionally talk about the CAVA project
    on his Elixir podcast, ElixirTalk.\nChris’ Talk - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkDhU-2NWJ8
    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkDhU-2NWJ8)\n1:58 - What are some of the high
    level advantages / disadvantages of Elixir, from your perspective?\nAdvantages:
    Elixir and Phoenix gives you rails-esque productivity/developer experience that
    scales. I think phoenix channels are a great example of this. Build a channel
    with complex real-time functionality and let it scale effortlessly. \nDisadvantages:
    \nHiring and onboarding, depending on your mindset, can be difficult. If you’re
    used to hiring for experience in  your stack, its just going to be more difficult.
    Lately we’ve started doing one-hour weekly knowledge shares that cover elixir
    basics and are closely tied to our usage of them. So, here’s a test case, and
    here are all of the test helpers that we have set up that will help you write
    that test. We also just sent a new Elixir dev to lonestar elixir \n3:59 - What
    do you use to host your Elixir app?\nHeroku \nHow do you deploy your application?
    \nHeroku-buildpack-elixir https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir
    (https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir) \n4:44 - Are you able to
    get zero downtime deploys?\n- As close as possible! We get that out of the box
    with heroku. When we deploy, heroku won’t point traffic to the new dyno until
    the app is healthy. We make extensive use of Phoenix channels over websockets,
    and our clients will reconnect automatically and transparently.  \n5:10 - Do you
    cluster the application?\nNope.  \n5:52 - How does your Elixir App perform compared
    to others in your environment?\nI can’t really talk about numbers here, but Elixir
    is not at all our bottleneck. We don’t have other production applications \n6:25
    - How are you solving background task processing?\nQuantum for cron jobs, genservers
    for everything else. We’re running a single elixir application that handles all
    synchronous and async processing  \n7:07 - What libraries are you using?\nPhoenix
    \nPhoenix_swagger for API documentation that integrates with controller tests
    https://github.com/xerions/phoenix_swagger (https://github.com/xerions/phoenix_swagger)
    \nEx_rated for rate limiting calls to our integrations https://github.com/grempe/ex_rated
    (https://github.com/grempe/ex_rated) \nTimex and calendar for datetime support
    with timezones https://github.com/bitwalker/timex (https://github.com/bitwalker/timex)
    \nA combination of httpotion and httpoison for HTTP clients, but im interested
    in trying Mint https://github.com/ericmj/mint (https://github.com/ericmj/mint)https://github.com/appcues/mojito
    (https://github.com/appcues/mojito) \nBamboo for transactional emails, like order
    confirmations etc https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo (https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo)
    \n8:59 - 3rd Party Services (i.e. Email, Payment Processing, etc)\nSendgrid for
    email, Google for geocoding, slack for some internal alerting of application health,
    LevelUp for payments. https://www.thelevelup.com/ (https://www.thelevelup.com/)
    \n10:07 - Do you have a story where Elixir saved the day in production?\nYes and
    no. So I could tell this story by explaining the issue we saw and the underlying
    cause at the same time, but I think it would be more fun to tell it like our team
    experienced it. \nOne day at lunch our application started going down. Lots of
    500 errors. Red lights flashing. Panic ensuing. Lunch is our busiest time of day,
    so 1) we thought it was load related and 2) we really needed to fix it \nNone
    of our traditional resources (database, cpu, memory) were constrained and our
    integrations that were synchronous were fine.  \nOur logs were littered with errors
    from an analytics integration that ran asynchronously on genservers, but it didn’t
    seem related because we could see the error logs at times when our application
    was otherwise healthy. The team that used the analytics didn’t have a pressing
    need for them, and we deprioritized fixing the issue because the bug we were working
    on was so much more important (that’s foreshadowing). \nI spent a little time
    looking at websockets, but I was easily able to match the load of the websocket
    portion of our application on my local machine with no degradations in performance
    (thanks, phoenix), so that was out. \nAt this point the issue was going on every
    day at lunch and I was getting annoyed at seeing the logs from the analytics integration
    when debugging, so I spent like 15 minutes finding and fixing the issue (a bad
    API key, basically) \nVoila, issue gone. Time to grab some lunch. \nWe spent a
    while coming up with an explanation for this. Eventually we learned about max_restarts
    on a supervisor. By default, if a process crashes 3 times in 5 seconds, the process
    won’t be restarted again. So if another process (like the one handling a web request)
    tries to call that process that wasn’t restarted, the caller would crash, and
    we’d start to get 500 errors, customers couldn’t log in, mass confusion. \nSo
    there are a few takeaways from this story: For a while, elixir saved the day in
    production.  \n    - A supervision tree prevented failures from the analytics
    process from affecting customers, until the scale of our failures exceeded the
    max_restart level.  \n    - Our supervision tree needed some love though, clearly.
    \n    - Monitor your resources. CPU is a resource, but calls to another API are
    also a resource and can get unhealthy too.  \n15:00 - Are you using any cool OTP
    features?\nGenServers, definitely. There’s lots we can do asynchronously especially
    in terms of our integrations. One process per store is a cool model that scales
    well and keeps issues isolated to a single store. \n15:50 - If you could give
    one tip to developers out there who are or may soon be running Elixir in production,
    what would it be?\nIf you’re on a small team, Heroku or a similar provider might
    give you a lot of value in terms of infrastructure you can set up and forget.\nLearn

    and past Elixir projects and how they are deployed.</p>\n\n<p>Jay Ashe - <a href=\"https://cava.com/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Cava</a></p>\n\n<p>Find Jay elsewhere online:<br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jgashe\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/jgashe</a></p>\n\n<p>0:40 - Give us a quick
    overview of the Elixir projects you have in production.</p>\n\n<p>CAVA is a fast-casual
    mediterranean restaurant chain with 75 stores across the US. Elixir and phoenix
    power CAVA’s online ordering platform (order.cava.com and the CAVA app). We’ve
    got a REST (and websockets) api sitting behind react and our mobile apps, and
    we use phoenix templates for some of our back of house systems.</p>\n\n<p>1:11
    - Why are you using Elixir in production?</p>\n\n<p>We have from the start! The
    application was originally implemented by Chris Bell and his team at madebymany.
    Chris, by the way, has a fantastic talk from ElixirConf 2016 that goes into our
    architecture and how we use elixir and OTP constructs to model our business logic.
    Chris will occasionally talk about the CAVA project on his Elixir podcast, ElixirTalk.</p>\n\n<p>Chris’
    Talk - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkDhU-2NWJ8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkDhU-2NWJ8</a></p>\n\n<p>1:58
    - What are some of the high level advantages / disadvantages of Elixir, from your
    perspective?</p>\n\n<p>Advantages: Elixir and Phoenix gives you rails-esque productivity/developer
    experience that scales. I think phoenix channels are a great example of this.
    Build a channel with complex real-time functionality and let it scale effortlessly.
    </p>\n\n<p>Disadvantages: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hiring and onboarding, depending on
    your mindset, can be difficult. If you’re used to hiring for experience in  your
    stack, its just going to be more difficult. Lately we’ve started doing one-hour
    weekly knowledge shares that cover elixir basics and are closely tied to our usage
    of them. So, here’s a test case, and here are all of the test helpers that we
    have set up that will help you write that test. We also just sent a new Elixir
    dev to lonestar elixir </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>3:59 - What do you use to host your
    Elixir app?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Heroku </p></li>\n<li><p>How do you deploy your
    application? </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Heroku-buildpack-elixir <a href=\"https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir</a> </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>4:44
    - Are you able to get zero downtime deploys?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As close as possible!
    We get that out of the box with heroku. When we deploy, heroku won’t point traffic
    to the new dyno until the app is healthy. We make extensive use of Phoenix channels
    over websockets, and our clients will reconnect automatically and transparently.<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>5:10
    - Do you cluster the application?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nope.<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>5:52
    - How does your Elixir App perform compared to others in your environment?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I
    can’t really talk about numbers here, but Elixir is not at all our bottleneck.
    We don’t have other production applications </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>6:25 - How are
    you solving background task processing?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Quantum for cron jobs,
    genservers for everything else. We’re running a single elixir application that
    handles all synchronous and async processing<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>7:07 - What
    libraries are you using?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Phoenix </li>\n<li>Phoenix_swagger for
    API documentation that integrates with controller tests <a href=\"https://github.com/xerions/phoenix_swagger\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/xerions/phoenix_swagger</a> </li>\n<li>Ex_rated
    for rate limiting calls to our integrations <a href=\"https://github.com/grempe/ex_rated\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/grempe/ex_rated</a> </li>\n<li>Timex and calendar
    for datetime support with timezones <a href=\"https://github.com/bitwalker/timex\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/bitwalker/timex</a> </li>\n<li>A combination

    - 3rd Party Services (i.e. Email, Payment Processing, etc)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sendgrid
    for email, Google for geocoding, slack for some internal alerting of application
    health, LevelUp for payments. <a href=\"https://www.thelevelup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.thelevelup.com/</a>
    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>10:07 - Do you have a story where Elixir saved the day in production?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes
    and no. So I could tell this story by explaining the issue we saw and the underlying
    cause at the same time, but I think it would be more fun to tell it like our team
    experienced it. </li>\n<li>One day at lunch our application started going down.
    Lots of 500 errors. Red lights flashing. Panic ensuing. Lunch is our busiest time
    of day, so 1) we thought it was load related and 2) we really needed to fix it
    </li>\n<li>None of our traditional resources (database, cpu, memory) were constrained
    and our integrations that were synchronous were fine.<br></li>\n<li>Our logs were
    littered with errors from an analytics integration that ran asynchronously on
    genservers, but it didn’t seem related because we could see the error logs at
    times when our application was otherwise healthy. The team that used the analytics
    didn’t have a pressing need for them, and we deprioritized fixing the issue because
    the bug we were working on was so much more important (that’s foreshadowing).
    </li>\n<li>I spent a little time looking at websockets, but I was easily able
    to match the load of the websocket portion of our application on my local machine
    with no degradations in performance (thanks, phoenix), so that was out. </li>\n<li>At
    this point the issue was going on every day at lunch and I was getting annoyed
    at seeing the logs from the analytics integration when debugging, so I spent like
    15 minutes finding and fixing the issue (a bad API key, basically) </li>\n<li>Voila,
    issue gone. Time to grab some lunch. </li>\n<li>We spent a while coming up with
    an explanation for this. Eventually we learned about max_restarts on a supervisor.
    By default, if a process crashes 3 times in 5 seconds, the process won’t be restarted
    again. So if another process (like the one handling a web request) tries to call
    that process that wasn’t restarted, the caller would crash, and we’d start to
    get 500 errors, customers couldn’t log in, mass confusion. </li>\n<li>So there
    are a few takeaways from this story: For a while, elixir saved the day in production.<br>\n
    \   - A supervision tree prevented failures from the analytics process from affecting
    customers, until the scale of our failures exceeded the max_restart level.<br>\n
    \   - Our supervision tree needed some love though, clearly. \n    - Monitor your
    resources. CPU is a resource, but calls to another API are also a resource and
    can get unhealthy too.<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>15:00 - Are you using any cool OTP
    features?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GenServers, definitely. There’s lots we can do asynchronously
    especially in terms of our integrations. One process per store is a cool model
    that scales well and keeps issues isolated to a single store. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>15:50
    - If you could give one tip to developers out there who are or may soon be running
    Elixir in production, what would it be?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you’re on a small
    team, Heroku or a similar provider might give you a lot of value in terms of infrastructure
    you can set up and forget.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Learn more about how SmartLogic uses

  description: "We talk with developers from the team here at SmartLogic about our
    current practices on deploying Elixir and Phoenix in production.\nDan Ivovich
    - Director of Development Operations @ SmartLogic\nLearn more about how SmartLogic
    uses Phoenix and Elixir. (https://smartlogic.io/phoenix-and-elixir)\n00:00 - Fade
    In\n00:30 - Introductions to Eric, Dan and SmartLogic\nDan Ivovich - Director
    of Development Operations @ SmartLogic\nEric Oestrich - Developer, Elixir Lead
    @ SmartLogic\nJustus Eapen - Full stack developer @ SmartLogic\nIntroduced to
    Elixir by an old colleague. \n1:20 - What Elixir projects do you have in production?
    \nSeveral client projects in production. Several Mobile Apps with APIs powered
    by Phoenix and Elixir. \nBaltimore Water Taxi. \nA digital marketplace.\nAnd more!\n1:57
    - Advantages and disadvantages to using Elixir.\nWe made the switch when a colleague
    was stoked about Functional Programming and introduced us to Elixir. We were won
    over by the performance and rich feature sets, OTP, etc.\n2:43 - Where are we
    hosting our Elixir Apps?\nHeroku \nAWS \nLinode \nDigital Ocean \n6:20Deployment
    process, tools, scripting\nAnsible - for underlying VPS’s, servers, and more recently
    deployment itself. (Similar to Capistrano).  \nDistillery  \nMix.release \n7:18
    - Zero Downtime Deployments\nOld school load balancers and rolling restarts \n7:46
    - What are the performance metrics like? Comparatively.\nRuby ends up with memory
    leaks. That doesn’t happen with Elixir. \nMemory utilization is flat and low no
    matter what. \n“Phenomenal response times” \n8:54 - How does Eric think about
    clustered applications in Elixir?\nGoing Multi Node (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCUKQnkjajo
    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCUKQnkjajo)) \nPg2 (http://erlang.org/doc/man/pg2.html)
    - process groups \nMnesia (http://erlang.org/doc/man/mnesia.html) distributed
    database (beware!) \n“Just sending messages to pids because Erlang is great” \nSwarm
    (https://github.com/bitwalker/swarm) / Horde (https://github.com/derekkraan/horde)
    \n12:40 - How do we handle background tasks?\nStarted with verk (https://github.com/edgurgel/verk)
    \nRecently becoming more comfortable with spinning up GenServers (https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html)
    \n“The language itself is built to be concurrent.” \n15:06 What libraries are
    we using in prod?\nFirst thing: You don’t need a whole lot because the language
    is so well designed. \nPhoenix (https://phoenixframework.org/) - web framework
    \nEcto (https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html) - sort of an ORM \nDistillery (https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery)
    - for releases \nBamboo (https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo) - for sending emails
    \nQuantum (https://github.com/c-rack/quantum-elixir) - for task scheduling \nTimex
    (https://github.com/bitwalker/timex) - for dates and times, and timezones \nCachex
    (https://github.com/whitfin/cachex) - for caching \n18:20- What third party integrations
    have we attempted\nStripe \nSquare \nTwilio \nMindbody \nAlways building our own
    clients.  Using HTTPoison (https://github.com/edgurgel/httpoison)\n19:58Has Elixir
    ever saved the day in production?\nIt’s saved many days by PREVENTING ISSUES.
    Systems are architected for reliability and fault-tolerance.\n21:48 - Where do
    supervision trees come from? What is OTP?\nOTP is an Erlang standard lib \nIncludes
    supervision trees, genservers, ETS, and a lot of stuff we don’t even know about!
    \ngen_tcp (http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_tcp.html) \nMnesia \ndets (http://erlang.org/doc/man/dets.html)
    \n23:43- Tips for devs considering running elixir in production.\nJump in and
    read the docs \nUnderstand how systems boot, distillery releases, config providers,
    etc. \n“Good server monitoring hygiene” \n“DIVE IN!” \n19:54 Outro\nLearn more
    about how SmartLogic uses Phoenix and Elixir. (https://smr.tl/2Hyslu8) Special

  contentEncoded: "\n        <p>We talk with developers from the team here at SmartLogic
    about our current practices on deploying Elixir and Phoenix in production.</p>\n\n<p>Dan
    Ivovich - Director of Development Operations @ SmartLogic</p>\n\n<p>Learn more
    about how SmartLogic uses <a href=\"https://smartlogic.io/phoenix-and-elixir\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Phoenix and Elixir.</a></p>\n\n<p>00:00 - Fade In</p>\n\n<p>00:30
    - Introductions to Eric, Dan and SmartLogic</p>\n\n<p>Dan Ivovich - Director of
    Development Operations @ SmartLogic</p>\n\n<p>Eric Oestrich - Developer, Elixir
    Lead @ SmartLogic</p>\n\n<p>Justus Eapen - Full stack developer @ SmartLogic</p>\n\n<p>Introduced
    to Elixir by an old colleague. </p>\n\n<p>1:20 - What Elixir projects do you have
    in production? </p>\n\n<p>Several client projects in production. Several Mobile
    Apps with APIs powered by Phoenix and Elixir. </p>\n\n<p>Baltimore Water Taxi.
    </p>\n\n<p>A digital marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>And more!</p>\n\n<p>1:57 - Advantages
    and disadvantages to using Elixir.</p>\n\n<p>We made the switch when a colleague
    was stoked about Functional Programming and introduced us to Elixir. We were won
    over by the performance and rich feature sets, OTP, etc.</p>\n\n<p>2:43 - Where
    are we hosting our Elixir Apps?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Heroku </li>\n<li>AWS </li>\n<li>Linode
    </li>\n<li>Digital Ocean </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>6:20Deployment process, tools, scripting</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ansible
    - for underlying VPS’s, servers, and more recently deployment itself. (Similar
    to Capistrano).<br></li>\n<li>Distillery<br></li>\n<li>Mix.release </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>7:18
    - Zero Downtime Deployments</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Old school load balancers and rolling
    restarts </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>7:46 - What are the performance metrics like? Comparatively.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ruby
    ends up with memory leaks. That doesn’t happen with Elixir. </li>\n<li>Memory
    utilization is flat and low no matter what. </li>\n<li>“Phenomenal response times”
    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>8:54 - How does Eric think about clustered applications in
    Elixir?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Going Multi Node (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCUKQnkjajo\"

    up <a href=\"https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">GenServers</a>
    </li>\n<li>“The language itself is built to be concurrent.” </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>15:06
    What libraries are we using in prod?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First thing: You don’t need
    a whole lot because the language is so well designed. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://phoenixframework.org/\"
