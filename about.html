    <h1>Our Team</h1>
    <p>SmartLogic's people came here to do the best work of their careers. Some left other jobs because they weren’t allowed to do the work they were capable of, and some simply  wanted to learn and be challenged daily. The team at SmartLogic is here because they love to code and want to develop great software.</p>
