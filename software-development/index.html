              <p>At SmartLogic, we build web applications that manage business logic, streamline workflows, and provide a great user experience. All the applications we build are either responsive web applications, mobile applications, or a combination of both. In some cases, responsive web apps can also be leveraged to extend the functionality of mobile applications. We’ve also implemented translation into a wide variety of languages including Chinese, Vietnamese, and Arabic.</p><br/>
              <p>We've been working with some of our web app clients for over 9 years; a few examples of responsive web apps we've built for clients include <a href="/case-studies/foliocollaborative">FolioCollaborative</a>, <a href="/case-studies/brookes-publishing">Brookes Publishing</a> and <a href="/case-studies/redshred">RedShred</a>.</p> <br/>

              <p>We offer user and workflow discovery and design along with prototyping and testing to help ensure the product you end up with solves for your real business need. Even when your desired outcomes and app functionality are clear, there's often a substantial amount of discovery and design work to do before development can begin.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>Our in-house product designer brings a deep background in user experience and visual design to our projects. Wireframes, mockups and prototypes are always a part of our workflow, and we can also provide brand discovery and design, empathy maps, user personas, and customer journey maps to make sure the product design is on target before we start application development. SmartLogic can also provide accessibility assessments and help you prioritize accessibility improvements in existing applications, as we did recently for <a href="/case-studies/brookes-vpat">ASQ Online</a>.</p><br/>

              <br/>
              <p>We manage the DevOps for many of the applications we build for clients, though clients always own the code repositories and cloud infrastructure we deploy to. We have APIs in production that handle 2.5M+ requests daily; we manage products deployed to a variety of cloud solutions including secure private clouds for HIPAA and other high-security requirements.</p> <br/>
              <p>We have experience working with the latest DevOps tools and best practices ranging from turnkey cloud deployment options like Heroku to more complex configuration tools including Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Vault, and Helm. We recently helped SimpleBet to transition their high-stakes large-scale architecture to Kubernetes, a container orchestration system. Our team can help you get your infrastructure set up and organized in such a way that it's easy to build on and maintain.</p><br/>
