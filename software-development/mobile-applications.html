      <h2>iOS App Design for a Patient-centered Care Survey</h2>

      <p>The <a href="/case-studies/ncqa">National Committee for Quality Assurance</a> (NCQA) reached out to us in 2017, looking to build a custom survey application to support their new Person Driven Outcomes methodology. This approach focuses on encouraging patients to set specific, measurable goals, and uses a follow-up system to track patient goals and outcomes.</p>
      <p>SmartLogic built a custom digital platform for the Person Driven Outcomes survey, complete with an API, iPad application, and web-based admin and reporting dashboard. The platform is HIPAA-compliant, securing all data in accordance with medical health records best practices.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The iPad app leverages adaptive technology to dramatically simplify the questionnaire flow, and also manages data smoothly between on- and off-line activity, saving data locally and syncing to the cloud when next connected in order to allow for surveys outside of network connectivity. Practitioners who are piloting the Person Driven Outcomes methodology use the iPad app with patients to help them set and monitor personal health goals; the methodology and app are currently being tested with 800 individuals across four states.</p>

      <h2>Cross Platform Development for a Social Gig Economy Startup</h2>
      <p>Baltimore-based startup <a href="/case-studies/knctrr">knctrr</a> engaged SmartLogic to build an app for their new gig-economy venture in 2019. The founders at knctrr had already pursued about 18 months of R&D and were ready to build their platform, but didn’t have an internal team available to build it, nor did they have the time to wait for hiring and onboarding a new team of developers.</p>

      </figure>


      <p>As a new startup, time was a crucial factor for knctrr; SmartLogic took their app from concept to production in under three months. The knctrr platform consists of an Elixir/Phoenix back end, fully responsive web-based front end, and companion React Native mobile iOS and Android apps. SmartLogic worked with knctrr on technical architecture decisions as well, including identifying and evaluating options for payment processors and chat options, as well as scalability and future-proofing decisions. SmartLogic's ability to deliver knctrr's application quickly helped to support their launch timeline and growth goals.</p>

      <blockquote>Going through such a deliberate and robust design process with SmartLogic before starting the development gave us the leg up we needed to finish on budget and ahead of schedule, while managing to release a sophisticated platform that is compatible with all devices.</blockquote>

      <h2>Mobile Application Development Services for a Modern Ticketing Platform</h2>

      <p>In 2016, the <a href="/case-studies/baltimore-water-taxi">Baltimore Water Taxi</a> was under new ownership and ready to modernize their ticketing system, which to date had relied on paper tickets, with no advance purchase options or internal reporting and analytics capabilities.</p>
      <p>The Water Taxi chose SmartLogic to build their application out, in part because of SmartLogic’s attention to learning about and understanding their unique business challenges; according to CEO Mike McDaniel, the SmartLogic team “grasped our business a lot faster than the others. The value of their getting our operations became evident throughout the project.”</p>

      <p>SmartLogic built a digital ticketing system for the Water Taxi, that enables purchases via the Water Taxi’s website, built by another vendor, and through the boat operators’ mobile app, built by SmartLogic.</p>
      <p>The new digital ticketing system gave customers a modern experience. It also gave the Water Taxi valuable insights into usage patterns, enabling them to identify infrequently used pickup locations. They then used that data to design more efficient routes for the following season that both reduced overhead and got customers to their destinations faster.</p>
